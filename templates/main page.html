						<h3>DEMAND ANALYSIS</h3>
						<p>law of demand: price increases, buyers buy less; because of substitution effect and income effect (real income increases)<br>
						defmand function: <span class="mathjax-exps">$Q_x^d=f(P_x,I,P_y)$</span><br>
						inverse demand function: <span class="mathjax-exps">$P_x=8.92-0.156Q_x^d$</span><br>
						demand curve: graph of inverse demand function<br>
						own-price elasticity of demand: <span class="mathjax-exps">$E_{P_x}^d=\frac{\%\Delta Q_x^d}{\%\Delta P_x}=\frac{\Delta Q_x^d}{\Delta P_x}\frac{P_x}{Q_x^d}$</span><br>
						elastic: <span class="mathjax-exps">$|E_{P_x}^d|&gt;1$</span>; inelastic: <span class="mathjax-exps">$|E_{P_x}|^d&lt; 1$</span>; unitary elastic: <span class="mathjax-exps">$|E_{P_x}^d|=1$</span><br>
						perfectly elastic: individual seller under perfectly competitive market<br>
						predictive of elasticity of demand: substitutability, portion of the budget spent on the good, the amount of time to respond to the price change, whether the good is necessary or optional<br>
						for seller: increase price under inelasiticity could decrease demand and save total production cost<br>
						income elasticity of demand: <span class="mathjax-exps">$E_{I}^d=\frac{\%\Delta Q_x^d}{\%\Delta I}$</span><br>
						normal good: <span class="mathjax-exps">$E_{I}^d&gt;0$</span>; inferior food: <span class="mathjax-exps">$E_{I}^d&lt; 0$</span><br>
						cross-price elasticity of demand: <span class="mathjax-exps">$E_{y}^d=\frac{\%\Delta Q_x^d}{\%\Delta P_y}$</span><br>
						substitutes: <span class="mathjax-exps">$E_{y}^d&gt;0$</span>; complements: <span class="mathjax-exps">$E_{y}^d&lt; 0$</span><br>
						substitute effect is true for both normal and inferior good<br>
						Giffen good (inferior good and income effect overwhelms substitute effect): prices increases and demand increases; Veblen good (not inferior good): e.g. luxury good<br>
						an method to decompose income effect and substitute effect: Consumer can pay an amount of money to have the privilege to buy good at a lower price, we adjust this privilege price until the consumer is indifferent (same level of utility), and see whether the good demand is increased</p>
						<h3>SUPPLY ANALYSIS</h3>
						<p>law of diminishing marginal returns (marginal product decreases with additional input units)<br>
						<span class="mathjax-exps">$TC=wL+rK$</span>, <span class="mathjax-exps">$L$</span> and <span class="mathjax-exps">$K$</span> are laboring and capital hours (firm seen as renting machines, because of the opportunity cost)<br>
						cost function: <span class="mathjax-exps">$C=f(Q)$</span>, production cost for given amount of output<br>
						total product, average product, marginal product<br>
						economic profit = total revenue (TR) - economic costs<br>
						accounting profit = total revenue (TR) - accounting cost<br>
						marginal cost consists of short-run marginal cost (SMC) and long-run marginal cost (LMC), <span class="mathjax-exps">$SMC =\frac{w}{MP_L}$</span><br>
						average (on units of output) variable cost (AVC) = <span class="mathjax-exps">$\frac{w}{AP_L}$</span><br>
						total cost (TC) = total fixed cost (TFC) + total variable cost (TVC)<br>
						quasi-fixed cost (fixed inside of some range), part of TFC</p>
						<p>A firm is said to break even if its TR is equal to its TC.<br>
						Economic costs are the sum of total accounting costs and implicit opportunity costs.<br>
						A firm whose revenue is equal to its economic costs is covering the opportunity cost of all of its factors of production, including capital. Economists would say that such a firm is earning normal profit, but not positive economic profit. It is earning a rate of return on capital just equal to the rate of return that an investor could expect to earn in an equivalently risky alternative investment (opportunity cost).<br>
						In the long run, the best a firm can do is to break even because of other entrants.<br>
						<p class='wrapper' style="text-align:center;">
						<img src="\images\CFA-Economics-supply%20analysis-equilibrium.png" width="50%" align="center"></p>
						<img src="\images\CFA-economics-supply%20analysis-shutdown.png" width="100%"><br>
						In the example of TC, opportunity of the asset is reflected in the MVC (return of asset) and TC (could have sold the machine)?</p>
						<p>LRAC curve is an envelope curve of SATC curve:<br>
						<img src="\images\CFA-Economics-supply analysis-lrac.png" width="100%"><br>
						The minimum point on the LRAC curve is referred to as the minimum efficient scale. The minimum efficient scale is the optimal firm size under perfect competition over the long run.</p>
						<h3>MARKET STRUCTURES ANALYSIS</h3>
						<p>perfect competition, monopolistic competition (cola, cosmetics), oligopoly, and monopoly<br>
						five factors determine market structure:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>The number and relative size of firms supplying the product;</li>
						<li>The degree of product differentiation;</li>
						<li>The power of the seller over pricing decisions;</li>
						<li>The relative strength of the barriers to market entry and exit;</li>
						<li>The degree of non-price competition.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><span class="mathjax-exps">$&#x3B5;_P = &#x2013;\frac{\%\Delta Q_x^d}{\%\Delta P_x}$</span><br>
						Consumer surplus is defined as the difference between the value that a consumer places on the units purchased and the amount of money that was required to pay for them. Demand curve can therefore be considered a marginal value curve</p>
						<h4>OLIGOPOLY</h4>
						<p>There are three basic pricing strategies: pricing interdependence (price war), the Cournot assumption, and the Nash equilibrium<br>
						pricing interdependence: DD is the demand curve when all participants make the same move, dd is the demand curve when only one participant make that move, which explains the price stability, but not the initial price:<br>
						<img src="\images\cfa-economics-market structure-kinked curve.jpg" width="100%"><br>
						In long run, market share is temporary.</p>
						<h4>COURNOT</h4>
						In the Cournot assumption, each firm determines its profit-maximizing production level by assuming that the other firms&#x2019; output will not change
						<h4>NASH EQUILIBRIUM</h4>
						<p>formal price collusion is called cartel, 6 factors:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>The number and size distribution of sellers</li>
						<li>The similarity of the products</li>
						<li>Cost structure</li>
						<li>Order size and frequency</li>
						<li>The strength and severity of retaliation</li>
						<li>The degree of external competition</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>STACKELBERG MODEL</h4>
						the leader firm chooses its output first and then the follower firm chooses after observing the leader&#x2019;s output
						<h3>MONOPOLY</h3>
						<p>factors: patent/copyright, control over critical resources, government-controlled authorization (because of the significant entry cost), brand loyalty and Network effects (result from synergies related to increasing market penetration)<br>
						*besides quantity and price, monopolist can also adjust the quality</p>
						<h3>PRICE DISCRIMINATION</h3>
						<p>first degree: perfect<br>
						second degree: quantity-based<br>
						third degree: customer-based</p>
						<h3>IDENTIFICATION OF MARKET STRUCTURE</h3>
						<p>econometric: regression<br>
						concentration ratio<br>
						Herfindahl&#x2013;Hirschman index (HHI): square of the market share</p>
						<h2>Macroeconomics</h2>
						<h3>AGGREGATE OUTPUT AND INCOME</h3>
						<h4>GDP</h4>
						<p>aggregate output = aggregate income = aggregate expenditure (the total amount spent on the goods and services produced)<br>
						in the (domestic) economy during the period<br>
						for simplicity, it is standard in macroeconomics to attribute all income to the household sector, because government is non-profit<br>
						Gross domestic product (GDP) measures:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>the market value of all final goods and services produced within the economy during a given period (output definition) or, equivalently,</li>
						<li>the aggregate income earned by all households, all companies, and the government within the economy during a given period (income definition).</li>
						</ul>
						<p>GDP criterion:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>All goods and services included in the calculation of GDP must be produced during the measurement period, excluding unemployment compensation and appreciation of asset</li>
						<li>those whose value can be determined by being sold in the market, excluding gardening and commuting (*two examples, government service, at cost and owner-occupied housing (easy to calculate, compared to self gardening), are included in GDP)</li>
						<li>Only the market value of final goods and services is included in GDP, excluding intermediate good</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Nominal <span class="mathjax-exps">$\text{GDP}_t=P_tQ_t$</span>; real <span class="mathjax-exps">$\text{GDP}_t=P_BQ_t$</span>, <span class="mathjax-exps">$P_B$</span> is price in the base years<br>
						GDP deflator=Nominal GDP/Real GDP*100<br>
						<span class="mathjax-exps">$\begin{aligned}\text{GDP}&amp;=C+I+G+(X&#x2212;M)\\ &amp;=(C+G_C)+(I+G_I)+(X&#x2212;M)\end{aligned}$</span><br>
						A trade deficit must be funded by a capital inflow.</p>
						<h4>GDI</h4>
						<p>GDP = Gross domestic income (GDI) = Net domestic income + Consumption of fixed capital (CFC) + Statistical discrepancy<br>
						<span class="mathjax-exps">$\begin{aligned} \text{GDP} &amp;= \text{Consumer spending on goods and services}\\ &amp;+\text{Business gross fixed investment}\\ &amp;+\text{Change in inventories}\\ &amp;+\text{Government spending on goods and services}\\ &amp;+\text{Government gross fixed investment}\\ &amp;+\text{Exports Imports}\\ &amp;+\text{Statistical discrepancy}\end{aligned}$</span><br>
						<span class="mathjax-exps">$\begin{aligned} \text{GDI}&amp;= \text{Compensation of employees}\\ &amp;+\text{Gross operating surplus}\\ &amp;+\text{Gross mixed income(farm, nonfarm, rent)}\\ &amp;+\text{Taxes less subsidies on production}\\ &amp;+\text{Taxes less subsidies on products and imports}\end{aligned}$</span><br>
						Personal income (household primary income) = Compensation of employees + Net mixed income + Net property income</p>
						<h4>Relationship among Saving, Investment, the Fiscal Balance and the Trade Balance</h4>
						<p><span class="mathjax-exps">$Y+F-S_B-R=C+S_H$</span>, where <span class="mathjax-exps">$Y$</span> is GDP, <span class="mathjax-exps">$F$</span> is transfer payment, <span class="mathjax-exps">$R$</span> is tax, <span class="mathjax-exps">$S_B$</span> is business saving<br>
						<span class="mathjax-exps">$\rightarrow$</span> <span class="mathjax-exps">$Y=C+S+T=C+(S_H+S_B)+(R-F)$</span><br>
						<span class="mathjax-exps">$\rightarrow$</span> <span class="mathjax-exps">$S=I+(G-T)+(X-M)$</span><br>
						<span class="mathjax-exps">$\rightarrow$</span> <span class="mathjax-exps">$(G-T)=(S-I)-(X-M)$</span><br>
						<span class="mathjax-exps">$C=C(Y-S_B-T)\approx C(Y-T)$</span><br>
						marginal propensity to consume, marginal propensity to save<br>
						average propensity to consume (APC), C/Y, is a good proxy for MPC<br>
						<span class="mathjax-exps">$I = I(r, Y)$</span>, decreasing in real interest rate <span class="mathjax-exps">$r$</span> and increasing in GDP<br>
						<span class="mathjax-exps">$G-T=\overline{G}-t(Y)$</span>, where <span class="mathjax-exps">$G$</span> is an exogenous policy and to some extent, <span class="mathjax-exps">$T$</span> depends on economic need</p>
						<h3>AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY</h3>
						<h4>AGGREGATE DEMAND</h4>
						<p>aggregate demand curve slopes downward because of:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>wealth effect</li>
						<li>interest rate effect: higher interest rate decreases investment demand and affect consumption (mainly large purchases)</li>
						<li>real exchange rate effect: internation good as substitutes; price increases, interest rate increas and then domestic currency appreciates</li>
						</ul>
						<p>price as dependent variable in this model, moves along the aggregate demand curve</p>
						<h4>AGGREGATE SUPPLY</h4>
						<p>The &#x201C;long run&#x201D; here is long enough that wages, prices, and expectations can adjust but not long enough that physical capital is a variable input. So <span class="mathjax-exps">$Y=F(\overline{K},\overline{L})=\overline{Y}$</span><br>
						<img src="\images\cfa-economics-marcro-aggregate supply.png" width="100%"><br>
						Shift in AD curve:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>Household Wealth: higher equity price makes it easier for household to achieve its wealth accumlation goals and increase consumption</li>
						<li>Consumer and Business Expectations</li>
						<li>Capacity Utilization: higher capacity, more investment and AD curve shifts to right</li>
						<li>Fiscal policy</li>
						<li>monetary policy: more money, lower interest rate, household will purchase durable good, credit limit will be raised and credit standard will be loosened</li>
						<li>exchange rate</li>
						<li>Growth in the Global Economy</li>
						</ul>
						<p>higer consumption implies higher equity price</p>
						<p>Shift in SRAS curve:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>Change in Nominal Wages: nominal wage increases, SRAS shifts to left, LRAS does not change</li>
						<li>Change in Input Prices</li>
						<li>Change in Expectations about Future Prices</li>
						<li>Change in Business Taxes and Subsidies</li>
						<li>Change in the Exchange Rate: domestic currency appreciates, material from other countries cheaper</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Shift in LRAS curve:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>supply of labor and quality of labor forces (human capital),</li>
						<li>supply of natural resources,</li>
						<li>supply of physical capital, and</li>
						<li>productivity and technology.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Equilibrium GDP and Prices</h4>
						<p>4 types of macroeconomic equilibrium:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>long-run equilibrium</li>
						<li>short-run recessionary gap<br>
						<img src="\images\cfa-economics-macro-recessionary gap.png" width="100%"><br>
						under this situation, invest less in cyclical companies (automobile and chemical) and more in defensive companies (food and pharmeceutical),</li>
						<li>short-run inflationary gap<br>
						<img src="\images\cfa-economics-macro-inflationary gap.png" width="100%"></li>
						<li>short-run stagflation<br>
						<img src="\images\cfa-economics-macro-stagflation.png" width="100%"></li>
						</ul>
						<h4>ECONOMIC GROWTH AND SUSTAINABILITY</h4>
						<p><strong>sustainable rate of economic growth</strong> : the rate of increase in the economy&#x2019;s productive capacity or potential GDP (LRAS).</p>
						<h5>Solow&apos;s model</h5>
						<p>production function: <span class="mathjax-exps">$Y=AF(L,K)$</span>, where <span class="mathjax-exps">$A$</span> is total factor productivity and could not be directly observed, but instead eastimated; it is a redisual effect.<br>
						assumption:</p>
						<ul>
						<li><span class="mathjax-exps">$tAF(L,K)=AF(tL,tK)$</span></li>
						<li>diminishing marginal productivity for any input solely</li>
						<li>no externalities for input</li>
						</ul>
						<p>there should be a convergence of incomes between developed and developing countires over time.<br>
						Growth in potential GDP = Growth in TFP + <span class="mathjax-exps">$W_L$</span> (Growth in labor) + <span class="mathjax-exps">$W_C$</span> (Growth in capital)<br>
						Growth in per capita potential GDP = Growth in TFP +<br>
						<span class="mathjax-exps">$W_C$</span> (Growth in capital-to-laborratio)<br>
						<img src="\images\cfa-economics-macro-economic growth.png" width="100%"><br>
						<span class="mathjax-exps">$A$</span> concludes: human capital (quality of labor), technology, natural resources, public infrastructure, pollution, economic environment (legal and political)<br>
						<span class="mathjax-exps">$Y/L=AF(1,K/L)$</span>, where <span class="mathjax-exps">$Y/L$</span> = Labor productivity = Real GDP/Aggregate hours<br>
						Potential GDP = Aggregate hours worked &#xD7; Labor productivity <span class="mathjax-exps">$\Rightarrow$</span> Potential growth rate = Long-term growth rate of aggregate hours worked +<br>
						Long-term labor productivity growth rate</p>
						<h3>BUSINESS CYCLES</h3>
						<p>business cycles rely mainly on business enterprises&#x2014;therefore, not agrarian societies or centrally planned economies.<br>
						Types of cycles:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>classical cycle: peak and trough</li>
						<li>growth cycle (which CFA use)</li>
						<li>growth rate cycle</li>
						</ul>
						<img src="\images\cfa-economics-macro-cycle.png" width="100%">
						<p>Four phases: recovery, expansion, slow down and contraction<br>
						equity market is a leading indicator of the economy<br>
						recession: Real GDP has two consecutive quarters of negative growth</p>
						<h4>CREDIT CYCLES</h4>
						<p>business cycles can be amplified because of finance cycle<br>
						monetary and fiscal policy traditionally concentrate on reducing the volatility of business cycles</p>
						<h4>DIFFERENT PERSEPCTIVES</h4>
						<p>Firm:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>Employment</li>
						<li>capital spending: first light equipment, then heavy equipment</li>
						<li>Inventory</li>
						</ul>
						<p>household:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>consumpytion: durable good &gt; service &gt; non-durable, in cyclical order</li>
						<li>income: durables move with disposable income, while service tracks permanant income (excludes sudden loss and gain)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Housing sector: late buying (like equity)<br>
						External trade sector</p>
						<h4>THEORETICAL CONSIDERATION</h4>
						<p>Neoclassical Economics, (RBC (real business cycle)):</p>
						<ul>
						<li>monetary and fiscal policy has lags/delays, amplifying the cycle</li>
						<li>invisible hand results from the utility maximization</li>
						<li>provide better information for market participants to allow price and production to adjust in time</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The Austrian School:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>stress monetary policy</li>
						<li>markets are flexible and prices are easy to adjust, supply curve (even short run) is actually steep</li>
						<li>policy maker should not intervene</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Monetarism:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>money supply needs to grow at a moderate rate</li>
						<li>business cycle results from exogenous shock and   government intervention, policy should be clear to decrease uncertainty for market participants</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Keynesianism:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>government should intervene more on fiscal policy, because confidence might be low</li>
						<li>nominal wage is sticky and supply curve is flat</li>
						<li>in the long run, we are all dead</li>

						<h4>INDICATOR</h4>
						<img src="\images\cfa-economics-macro-indicator.png" width="100%">
						<h4>UNEMPLOYMENT</h4>
						<p>Labor force = employed + unemployed (who are seeking jobs), unemployed consists of long-term unemployed and frictionally unemployed<br>
						unemployment rate = unemployed/labor force<br>
						participation rate = labor force/working age<br>
						underemployed<br>
						discouraged worker: those who stopped looking for a job</p>
						<h4>INFLATION</h4>
						<p>deflation, hyperinflation and disinflation (slowdown inflation)<br>
						hyperinfaltion has a vicious circle like machanism (price increases, people are eager to change money into real good)<br>
						price index: fisher index = sqrt of (Laspeyres index (old basket) and Paasche index (new basket))<br>
						Laspeyres index&apos;s biases: substitution bias, quality bias and new product bias<br>
						CPI (consumer price index) and PPI (producer price index)<br>
						headline inflation (all goods) and core inflation (except food and energy), core inflation is to exclude the effect of short term changes<br>
						cost push (wage) inflation and demand pull inflation<br>
						non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) (effective index before unemployment reaches low levels)<br>
						unit labor cost (ULC) = output per hour per worker/total labor compensation per hour per worker</p>
