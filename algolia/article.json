serves as a framework  Stakeholder groups  stakeholder groups:    shareholders: controlling shareholders and non-controlling shareholders (minority shareholders)  creditors  Managers and Employees  Board of Directors  customers and suppliers  governments/regulators    Principal–agent and other relationships in corporate governance    Shareholder and Manager/Director Relationships: shareholder more risk tolerated  Controlling and Minority Shareholder Relationships  Manager and Board Relationships  Shareholder versus Creditor Interests    Stakeholder management  Mechanisms of Stakeholder Management：    general meeting (AGM):  Extraordinary general meetings: merger and acquisition, sale of siginificant asset, amendent to bylaw  shareholder → board of director → top management of the company  The Audit Function  Reporting and Transparency  Policies on Related-Party Transactions: voted excluding the director holding the interest  Remuneration Policies  say on pay (薪酬话语权)    Mitigate associated stakeholder risks  indentrue (bond contract): usually have covenants and collateral  risk from violation employee's right: labor law, supervisory board, works council  Company boards and committees  one-tier hierarchy: non-executive directors are not employees  independent director (specifict non-executive director): not having material relationship with company  two-tier hierarchy: supervisory board, management board  CEO and the chairperson may be the different persons  staggered boards: a method which elects a portion of board member a year  responsibility: duty of care and duty of loyalty  committee:    audit committee  governance committee  remuneration or compensation committee: including evaluating performance of managers  nomination committee  risk committee  investment committee    Factors affecting corporate governance and stakeholder management  market factors: shareholder engagement (AGM), Shareholder activism (lawsuit, hedge fund), competition and takeover  non-market factors: legal environment, media and corporate governance industry (which provides governance ratings and proxy advice)  Risks and benefits of corporate governance and stakeholder management  Risks of Poor Governance and Stakeholder Management:    Weak Control Systems  Ineffective Decision Making  Legal, Regulatory, and Reputational Risks  Default and Bankruptcy Risks    Benefits of Effective Governance and Stakeholder Management  Factors relevant to corporate governance and stakeholder management analysis    Economic Ownership and Voting Control:

impact investing: to generate positive impact    Investment approach  value-based investment approach: to mitigate risk and identify opportunity  values-based: express moral belief  a continuum of investment approaches:    negative screening  postivie screening: relative best-in-class  ESG integration: consideration of material ESG factors  thematic investing  engagement/active ownership

It is earning a rate of return on capital just equal to the rate of return that an investor could expect to earn in an equivalently risky alternative investment (opportunity cost).  In the long run, the best a firm can do is to break even because of other entrants.          In the example of TC, opportunity of the asset is reflected in the MVC (return of asset) and TC (could have sold the machine)?  LRAC curve is an envelope curve of SATC curve:      The minimum point on the LRAC curve is referred to as the minimum efficient scale. The minimum efficient scale is the optimal firm size under perfect competition over the long run.  Market structures analysis  perfect competition, monopolistic competition (cola, cosmetics), oligopoly, and monopoly  five factors determine market structure:    The number and relative size of firms supplying the product;  The degree of product differentiation;  The power of the seller over pricing decisions;  The relative strength of the barriers to market entry and exit;  The degree of non-price competition.    $ε_P = –\\frac{\\%\\Delta Q_x^d}{\\%\\Delta P_x}$  Consumer surplus is defined as the difference between the value that a consumer places on the units purchased and the amount of money that was required to pay for them. Demand curve can therefore be considered a marginal value curve  Oligopoly  There are three basic pricing strategies: pricing interdependence (price war), the Cournot assumption, and the Nash equilibrium  pricing interdependence: DD is the demand curve when all participants make the same move, dd is the demand curve when only one participant make that move, which explains the price stability, but not the initial price:      In long run, market share is temporary.  Cournot  In the Cournot assumption, each firm determines its profit-maximizing production level by assuming that the other firms’ output will not change  Nash equilibrium  formal price collusion is called cartel, 6 factors:    The number and size distribution of sellers  The similarity of the products  Cost structure  Order size and frequency  The strength and severity of retaliation  The degree of external competition    Stackelberg model  the leader firm chooses its output first and then the follower firm chooses after observing the leader’s output  Monopoly  factors: patent/copyright, control over critical resources, government-controlled authorization (because of the significant entry cost), brand loyalty and Network effects (result from synergies related to increasing market penetration)  *besides quantity and price, monopolist can also adjust the quality  Price discrimination  first degree: perfect  second degree: quantity-based  third degree: customer-based  Identification of market structure  econometric: regression  concentration ratio  Herfindahl–Hirschman index (HHI): square of the market share  "}, {"title": "CFA I - Economics (2)", "path": "/pages/CFA I/CFA I - Economics (2).html", "category": "CFA I", "createdate": "2022-12-11", "editdate": "2022-12-11", "tags": "Economics", "content": "    Monetary policy  Money  money fulfills three important functions:    acts as a medium of exchange;  provides individuals with a way of storing wealth; and  provides society with a convenient measure of value and unit of account.    promissory note $\\rightarrow$ money creation $\\rightarrow$ fractional reserve banking  money multiplier: 1/reserve rate  narrow money: the notes and coins in circulation in an economy, plus other very highly liquid deposits;  Broad money: also includes the entire range of liquid assets that can be used to make purchases.

Unrealized holding gains and losses on a certain category of investment securities  Certain costs of a company’s defined benefit post-retirement plans that are not recognized in the current period    Income statement typically includes trading or holding asset  OCI includes available-for-sale asset (neither holding nor trading)  held-to-maturity debt securities reported at amortized cost, no unrealized gains or losses are reported  Balance sheets  Current and non-current classification  current/noncurrent asset (classified balance sheet) and liquidity-based presentation  current asset: expected to be sold, used up, or otherwise realized in cash within one year or one operating cycle of the business, whichever is greater  non-current asset (long-term, long-lived assets)  business cycle: from acquiring inventory to collect sale cash; from acquiring raw material to covert those into cash  current liability (or):    expected to be settled in the entity’s normal operating cycle  held primarily for the purpose of being traded  due to be settled within one year after the balance sheet date  does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least one year after the balance sheet date    working capital = current asset - current liability  Current assets  Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and trade receivables  Cash and Cash Equivalents are financial assets  Financial assets are reported at amortised cost or fair value  trade receivable (account receivable) is also financial asset, reported at net realizable value, approximation for fair value  allowance for doubtful accounts is called a contra account  Inventories and other current assets  Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value  *under GAAP, when using LIFO or retail inventory method, the lower of cost or market value (replacement cost which less than NRV and more than NRV less a normal profit margin)  Subsequent reversal of an inventory write-down is allowed under IFRS, but not under GAAP  OTHER CURRENT ASSETS: a typical item is prepaid expense,  Current liabilities  Trade credit is a source of financing  Accrued expenses (accrued expenses payable, accrued liabilities, or other non-financial liabilities): recognized as expense but not paid, such as tax payable, interest payable  Deferred income (deferred revenue or unearned revenue): receive payment in advance of good delivery  Non-current assets  Property, plant and equipment and investment property  Property, plant, and equipment (PPE)  Land is not depreciated  Impairment occurs when recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount:    Recoverable amount: The higher of an asset’s fair value less cost to sell, and its value in use  Value in use: The present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset    Reversals of impairment losses are permitted under IFRS but not under US GAAP  revaluation model: the reported is the fair value at the date of revaluation less subsequent depreciation  under the fair value model, investment property's gain or loss arising from change in fair value of investment property is recognized in profit and loss  Intangible assets  cost model or revaluation model  Intangible assets are identifiable non-monetary assets without physical substance  identifiable asset: can be acquired singly (can be separated from the entity) or is the result of specific contractual or legal rights or privilege  accounting goodwill is not a separately identifiable asset  The revaluation model can only be selected when there is an active market for an intangible asset.  assets (like management skill, good reputation) may be recognised as goodwill if a company is acquired, but are not recognised until an acquisition occurs  internally created identifiable intangibles are expensed rather than reported on the balance sheet, under IFRS, research phase cost should be expensed and development phase cost may be capitalized; under GAAP, most cost should be expensed  expensed cost include:    internally generated brands, mastheads, publishing titles, customer lists  start-up costs  training costs  administrative and other general overhead costs  advertising and promotion  relocation and reorganization expenses  redundancy and other termination costs    Goodwill  purchase price's excess amount higher than identifiable assets net of liabilities  accounting goodwill arising from acquisitions is capitalized, not amortised but tested for impairment annually (impairment loss against income)  Any gain from a bargain purchase is recognized in profit and loss  analysts often adjust the companies’ financial statements by removing the impact of goodwill  Financial assets  fair value or amortised cost method  amortised cost method: initially recognized amount, minus principal repayments, plus or minus amortisation of discount or premium, and minus reduction for

required yield or required rate of return  Relationships between the Bond Price and Bond Characteristics:    the percentage price change is greater when the market discount rate goes down than when it goes up  a lower-coupon bond has a greater percentage price change when their market discount rates change by the same amount  Generally, for the same coupon rate, a longer-term bond has a greater percentage price change when their market discount rates change by the same amount    constant-yield price trajectory: price approaches par value as time-to-maturity approaches to 0  Prices and yields: conventions for quotes and calculations  When between coupon payment dates, bond's price has two parts: the flat price and the accrued interest, the sum is called invoice or dirty price (true

Analysts usually use only the most recently issued and actively traded government bonds to build a yield curve  A par curve is a sequence of par rate (coupon rate) such that each bond is priced at par value under spot rate  cash market securities: traded on a cash basis, settle on T+0  forward rate notation: \"the 2y5y\" or \"the 2’s, 5’s\", the tenor is 5 years after two years  Implied forward rate: calculated from spot rate  A forward curve is a series of forward rates, each having the same time frame (maturity), different time from now  The maturity structure of interest rates  yield-to-maturity = benchmark + spread  on-the-run security: the most recently issued government bond  on-the-run security usually has lower YTM because of gain or loss, etc.  G-spread: spread over an actual or interpolated government bond  I-spread: The yield spread over the standard swap rate in that currency of the same tenor  Z-spread (zero-volatility spread): the spread over spot rate to discount the bond cash flow to its current price  option-adjusted spread = Z-spread - option value (in bps per year)  Introduction to asset-backed securities  How securitization works  special purpose entity (SPE) or special purpose vehichle (SPV)    important legal documentation: purchase agreement between the seller of the collateral and the SPE, prospectus (structure of the securitization)  monoline insure typically provides external credit enhancement  SPE is issuer and the seller of colleteral is depositor  Structure of a securitization  subordination/credit tranching  time tranching is to mitigate prepayment risk  Access to lower funding cost is a key role of the SPE in a securitizations, because of being not affected by the bankruptcy of the seller of the colleteral  Residential mortgage loans  mortgage loan  foreclosure allows the lender to take possession of the mortgaged property  loan-to-value ratio (LTV): loan/property's value  prime loan and subprime loan (lower credit quality and/or without first lien on the property)  Interest rate determination  mortgage rate, contract rate, or note rate  Fixed rate, adjustable or variable rate, initial period fixed rate and convertible (borrower has option to convert mortgage to fixed or adjustable one)  Amortization schedule  interest-only mortgage is also available, where principal repayment is not required for a certain period  bullet mortgage  Prepayment options and prepayment penalties  prepayment penalty mortgages  Rights of the lender in a foreclosure  recourse loan, the lender has a claim against the borrower for the shortfall between the amount of the outstanding mortgage balance and the proceeds received from the sale of the property  underwater mortgages: value of property less than loan owed to lender  Mortgage pass-through securities  residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) can be divided into 3 sectors, the first two are called agency RMBS:    guaranteed by a federal agency  guaranteed by a government-sponsored enterprises  issued by private entities    non-conforming mortgage: does not satisfy standard for agency RMBS  Mortgage pass-through securities  pass-through rate is lower than mortgage rate by an amount of administrative fee  weighted average coupon rate (WAC) and weighted average maturity  Prepayment Risk:    Contraction risk: interest rate declines and prepayment  extension risk: interest rate increases and delayed payment    Prepayment Rate Measures:  SMM (single monthly mortality rate) = Prepayment for the month/(Beginning outstanding mortgage balance for the month - scheduled principal repayment for the month)  conditional prepayment rate is annualized SMM  Collateralized mortgage obligations and non-agency rmbs  the collateral is usually a pool of mortgage pass-through securities  Sequential-pay CMO structures  time tranching, reduce prepayment risk  CMO structures including planned amortization class and support tranches  the creation of an MBS, whether it is a mortgage pass-through or a CMO, cannot make prepayment risk disappear  it consists of planned amortization class (PAC) tranches and non-PAN tranches called support tranches  the principal repayment goes to PAC class as scheduled first then absorbed by the tranch  Commercial mortgage-backed securities  Credit risk  non-recourse loan  two key indicator:    loan-to-value ratio  debt-service-coverage (DSC) ratio: net operating income/(annual interest+annual principal repayment)    CMBS structure  Call Protection:    prepayment lockout  Prepayment penalty points  A yield maintenance charge, or make-whole charge: indifferent as to the timing of prepayment  defeasance: the borrow provides cash flow that would exist in the absence of prepayments    Balloon Maturity Provision: ballon risk: fails to make the balloon payment and extends it to the workout period (with higher interest)  Non-mortgage asset-backed securities  non-amortizing loan ABS, reinvest prepayment in the lockout period and distribute to bond classes when lockout period is over  Auto loan ABS  reserve account: excess spread account  Credit card receivable ABS  credit card receivable is non-amortizing loan  The only way the principal cash flows can be altered is by the triggering of the early amortization provision.  Collateralized debt obligations  Collateralized debt obligation (CDO) is a generic term used to describe a security backed by a diversified pool of one or more debt obligations  SPE: colleteral manager, to earn profit  structure: equity tranche (might realize equity-like return)  If the CDO manager fails pre-specified tests, a provision requires the payoff of the principal to the senior bond class until the tests are satisfied.  Covered bonds  Covered bonds offer bondholders dual recourse—to both the issuing financial institution and the underlying asset pool  covered bond (or “cover pool”) remains on the financial institution’s balance sheet  cover pool sponsors must replace any prepaid or non-performing assets (i.e., assets that do not generate the promised cash flows) in the cover pool to ensure sufficient cash flows until the maturity of the covered bond.

The implied volatilities used to create the VIX index are as follows:        Average the put and call implied volatilities for each strike and maturity to reduce the number of volatilities.  $$\\sigma_1^{X_l}=\\left(\\sigma_{c, 1}^{X_l}+\\sigma_{p, 1}^{X_l}\\right) / 2\\\\ \\sigma_1^{X_u}=\\left(\\sigma_{c, 1}^{X_u}+\\sigma_{p, 1}^{X_u}\\right) / 2\\\\ \\sigma_2^{X_l}=\\left(\\sigma_{c, 2}^{X_l}+\\sigma_{p, 2}^{X_l}\\right) / 2\\\\ \\sigma_2^{X_u}=\\left(\\sigma_{c, 2}^{X_u}+\\sigma_{p, 2}^{X_u}\\right) / 2$$  Average the implied volatilities above and below the index level as follows:  $$\\sigma_1=\\sigma_1^{X_l}\\left(\\frac{X_u-S}{X_u-X_l}\\right)+\\sigma_1^{X_u}\\left(\\frac{S-X_l}{X_u-X_l}\\right)\\\\ \\sigma_2=\\sigma_2^{X_l}\\left(\\frac{X_u-S}{X_u-X_l}\\right)+\\sigma_2^{X_u}\\left(\\frac{S-X_l}{X_u-X_l}\\right)$$  Calculate the VIX is to interpolate between (or extrapolate from) the two maturities to create a 30 calendar day (22 trading day) implied volatility index.  $$V I X_{\\text {old }}=\\sigma_1\\left(\\frac{N_{t_2}-22}{N_{t_2}-N_{t_1}}\\right)+\\sigma_2\\left(\\frac{22-N_{t_2}}{N_{t_2}-N_{t_1}}\\right)$$  where $N_{t_1}$ and $N_{t_2}$ are the number of trading days to maturity of the two contracts.    2003-2014  The generalized formula used in the VIX Index calculation is:  $$\\sigma^2=\\frac{2}{T} \\sum_i \\frac{\\Delta K_i}{K_i^2} e^{R T} Q\\left(K_i\\right)-\\frac{1}{T}\\left[\\frac{F}{K_0}-1\\right]^2$$  where    $VIX =100\\sigma$  $F$ is option-implied forward price (from put-call parity)  $K_0$ is first strike equal to or otherwise immediately below the forward index level, $F$  $K_i$ is strike price of the $i$th OTM option  $\\Delta K_i=\\frac{K_{i+1}-K_{i-1}}{2}$  $Q(K_i)$ is the midpoint of the bid-ask spread for each option with strike $K_i$    2014-now  The VIX is a 30-day expectation of volatility given by a weighted portfolio of out-of-the-money European options on the S&P 500:  $$  VIX=\\sqrt{\\frac{2 e^{r \\tau}}{\\tau}\\left(\\int_0^F \\frac{P(K)}{K^2} d K+\\int_F^{\\infty} \\frac{C(K)}{K^2} d K\\right)}  $$  where ${\\tau }$ is the number of average days in a month (30 days), $r$ is the risk-free rate, $F$ is the 30-day forward price on the S&P 500, and $P(K)$ and $C(K)$ are prices for puts and calls with strike $K$ and 30 days to maturity.
