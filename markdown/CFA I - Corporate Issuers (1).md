<!-- 645 -->
type of capital projects, roughly ranked by risk:

terminology:
* required rate of return (opportunity cost of funds, cost of capital or hurdle rate)

* Conventional cash flows: outflow first then a series of inflow
* nonconventional cash flows
  
actual senerios:
* Independent projects versus mutually exclusive projects: must choose one among several projects
* Project sequencing
* Unlimited funds versus capital rationing: a fixed amount of funds to invest


<h4>Investment decision criteria</h4>
<!--  -->
net present value and internal rate of return 
NPV is always preferred over IRR: calculation implies investing at IRR for a long term and didn't indicate investment size, for example, see mutually exclusive projects A and B, A: invest 100 and gain 200, B invest 10000 and gain 12000
return on invested capital (ROIC): net profit/average invested capital
if ROIC higher than COC (cost of capital), NPV is positive
Inflation reduces the value of depreciation tax savings to the company and thus increases real tax

<h4>Real options</h4>

timing option: like delay investment one year
sizing option: abandonment option and growth/expansion option
flexibility option: price-setting option and production-flexibility option
fundamental option: the whole investment is an option
