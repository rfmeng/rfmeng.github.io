<h3>MONETARY POLICY</h3>
<h4>MONEY</h4>
<!--  -->
money fulfills three important functions:
* acts as a medium of exchange;
* provides individuals with a way of storing wealth; and
* provides society with a convenient measure of value and unit of account.

promissory note $\rightarrow$ money creation $\rightarrow$ fractional reserve banking
money multiplier: 1/reserve rate
narrow money: the notes and coins in circulation in an economy, plus other very highly liquid deposits;  Broad money: also includes the entire range of liquid assets that can be used to make purchases.
QUANTITY THEORY: $MV=PY$, accounting identity, the amount of money used to purchase all product equal to monetary value of this output
DEMAND: transaction money balances, precautionary money balances and speculative money balances (moves with bond risk)
SUPPLY AND DEMAND: at any one time, money supply (fixed amount of nominal value) is fixed, and money demand slopes downward (speculative money demand decreases)
money neutrality: money supply in the
long run increase price level while leaving real unchanged
The Fisher Effect: $R_{nom}=R_{real}+\pi^e(+\text{ risk premium})$, real interest rate is relativley stable
