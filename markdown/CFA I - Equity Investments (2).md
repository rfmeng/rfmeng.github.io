<h3>Overview of equity securities</h3>
<h4>Characteristics of equity securities</h4>
<!-- 280 -->
Common Shares:
* statutory voting: when electing board member, one vote for one director
* cumulative voting: votes (from other directors) can be used on a single director

Preference Shares：cumulative and non-cumulative, Participating and no-participating (whether share company's profit)
Convertible preference shares (convertible to common share)

<h4>Private versus public equity securities</h4>
<!--  -->
venture capital: exit return when company goes public
leveraged buyout, management buyout
private investment in public equity

<h4>Non-domestic equity securities</h4>
<!--  -->
depositary receipt
sponsored DR: company participates in issuance
unsponsored DR: depositary bank retains voting right
global depositary receipt: cannot be traded in America
American depository receipt and American depository share
Global Registered Share

<h4>Risk and return characteristics</h4>
<!--  -->
dividend reinvestment is important and significant
when company is liquidated, preference shareholder will receive the fixed par value
Callable common or preference shares: the issuer has the option to redeem the shares at a pre-determined price

<h4>Equity and company value</h4>
<!---->
ROE
blue chip stock: large market capitalization and leaders in their industry
the company’s cost of equity may be different from the investors’ minimum required rate of return on equity, but that will be relected in the price
The ultimate goal of management is to increase the book value (shareholders’ equity on a company’s balance sheet) of the company and maximize the market value of its equity.


<h3>Introduction to industry and company analysis</h3>
<h4>Uses of industry analysis</h4>
<!--  -->
industry rotation strategy: timing investments in industries in relation to an analysis of industry fundamentals and/or business-cyclecondition

<h4>Approaches to identifying similar companies</h4>
sector consists of industries
<h5>Products and/or services supplied</h5>
<!-- 309 -->
principal business activity: source from which company derives a majority of its revenues
<h5>Business-cycle sensitivities</h5>
<!--  -->
whether correlated with the overall economy
cyclical industry: autos, housing, basic materials, industrials, and technology
non-cyclical industry: food and beverage, health care and utility
<h5>Statistical similarities</h5>
based on correlation of return

<h4>Industry classification systems</h4>
<!--  -->
commercial classification system usually only include public for-profit companies
peer group

<h4>Principles of strategic analysis</h4>
<!--  -->
Porter's 5 force: 
* intra-industry rivalry
* bargaining power of supplier
* bargaining power of customer
* threat of new entrants
* threat of new substitutes
<h5>Barriers to entry</h5>
<!--  -->
look history participants to identify barrier
affect pricing power, but higher barrier does not guarantee high pricing power, high quit cost results in overcapacity
<h5>Industry concentration</h5>
<!--  -->
use HHI, sum of square of market fraction
correlates to pricing power but not determinant
<h5>Industry capacity</h5>
tighter capacity, higher pricing power
<h5>Market share stability</h5>
<h5>Price competition</h5>
<!--  -->
industry where price weighs heavily in the purchase of customer has more fierce price competition
capital intensive industry like auto has low pricing power because of easily found substitutes
<h5>Industry life cycle</h5>
<!--  -->
stages:
* embryonic: high price due to lack of economy of scale
* growth: lowest entry barrier, increasing income reduce need of market capital
* shakeout: slowing growth rate, profitability starts to decline
* mature: little or no growth
* decline: technological substitution or competition decreases the demand

the cycle of industry is little predictive under change

<h4>External influences on industry</h4>
<!-- 337 -->
Macroeconomic, technological, Demographic (population age), governmental, social (how people consume), environmental (greenhouse gas effect drives customer in livestock away) 

<h4>Company analysis</h4>
<!--  -->
Company analysis includes financial position anlysis, products and/or services anlysis, and competitive strategy anlysis
Low-cost strategy: low price at some stage for market share
Differentiation strategies: 

<h3>Equity valuation: concepts and basic tools</h3>
<h4>Categories of equity valuation models</h4>
<!-- 364 -->
Present value models (or discounted cash flow models): dividend discount models and free-cash-flow-to-equity models
Multiplier models: Enterprise value (EV) multiples have the form (Enterprise value)/(Value of a fundamental variable)
Asset-based valuation models

<h4>Background for the dividend discount model</h4>
<!--  -->
extra/special dividend: irregular dividend
stock dividend (bonus issue of shares): stock as dividend
share repurchase is viewed as equivalent to the payment of cash dividends of equal value
declaration date, ex-dividend rate, holder-of-record rate and payment date: price falls on ex-dividend rate

<h4>Dividend discount model (ddm) and free-cash-flow-to-equity model (fcfe)</h4>
<!-- rushing mark -->
dividend discount model: $V_0=\sum\frac{D_t}{(1+r)^t}+\frac{P_n}{(1+r)^n}$
free-cash-flow-to-equity: FCFE = CFO – FCInv + Net borrowing and $V_0=\sum\frac{\text{FCFE}_t}{(1+r)^t}$

<h4>Preferred stock valuation</h4>
for non-callable,non-convertible preferred stock: $V_0=\frac{D_0}{r}$

<h4>The Gordon growth model</h4>
<!--  -->
the Gordon model assumes Dividends are the correct metric to use for valuation purposes
$V_0=\sum\frac{D_0(1+g)^t}{(1+r)^t}=\frac{D_0(1+g)}{r-g}$
$g=b\times ROE$, where $b$ is earnings retention rate = (1 – Dividend payout ratio)

<h4>Multistage dividend discount models</h4>
<!--  -->
two stage: an initial finite high growth period $n$ with a long sustainable period
$V_0=\sum_{t=1}^{n}\frac{D_0(1+g_S)^t}{(1+r)^t}+\frac{V_n}{(1+r)^n}$
$V_n=\frac{D_{n+1}}{r-g_L}$
$D_{n+1}=D_0(1+g_S)^n(1+g_L)$

<h4>Multipler models and relationship among price multiples, present value models, and fundamentals</h4>
<!--  -->
justified value of a multiple: the value justified by (based on) fundamentals or a set of cash flow predictions
justified P/E ratio (called related to fundamentals): $P_0=\frac{D_1}{r-g}$, $\frac{P_0}{E_1}=\frac{D_1/E_1}{r-g}=\frac{p}{r-g}$, where $p$ is payout ratio

<h4>Method of comparables and valuation based on price multiples</h4>
<h4>Enterprise value</h4>
<!--  -->
Enterprise value: market capitalization + market value of preferred stock + market value of debt - cash and investments (cash equivalents and short-term investments)
EV/EBITDA or EV/operating income

<h4>Asset-based valuation</h4>
<!--  -->
The asset-based valuation approach is most applicable when: the market value is readily determinable and the intangible assets are of a small proportion
