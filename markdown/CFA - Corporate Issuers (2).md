<h3>COST OF CAPITAL</h3>
<!-- 6 -->
cost of capital comes from required rate of return and is marginal cost
WACC (weighted average cost of capital) or MCC (marginal cost of capital)
WACC should be calculated using target capital structure:
$\text{WACC}= w_dr_d(1-t)+w_pr_p+w_er_e$

<h4>COSTS OF THE VARIOUS SOURCES OF CAPITAL</h4>
<h5>debt</h5>
<!--  -->
YTM (yield to maturity) is IRR, YTM devided by 2 to calculate semiannual discount rate
to estimate before-tax cost, use YTM approach and debt-rating approach
fixed-rate perpetual preferred stock

<h5>prefered stock</h5>
<!--  -->
fixed-rate perpetual preferred stock: noncallable with fixed dividend rate, $P_p=D_p/r_p$
<h5>common equity</h5>
<!--  -->
CAPM (capital asset pricing model): $
\mathbb{E}R_i=R_f+\beta_i(\mathbb{E}R_M-R_f)$, where $\mathbb{E}R_M-R_f$ is market risk premium (or equity risk premium)
multifactor model: $\mathbb{E}R_i=R_f+\sum_j\beta_{i,j}(\text{factor risk premium})_j$
to estimate market risk premium, use historical data or survey approach
Bond Yield plus Risk Premium Approach: $r_e=r_d+\text{risk premium}$


<h4>ESTIMATING BETA</h4>
<h5>public companies</h5>
<!--  -->
use regression and then adjust it as Adjusted beta = (2/3)(Unadjusted beta) + (1/3)(1.0), because beta tends to regress toward 1.0
<h5>thinly traded and nonpublic companies</h5>
<!--  -->
estimate asset (unlevered) beta from peer company (or comparable company), then calculate the equity beta: $\beta_a=\frac{E}{E+(1-t)D}\beta_e+\frac{(1-t)D}{E+(1-t)D}\beta_d$
understanding asset beta in this way: investing in asset will generate return $R_a$, see it as a asset allocation with return $R_d$ and $R_e$, to exclude effect of tax, it is equivalent to adjust the weight


<h4>FLOTATION COSTS</h4>
<!--  -->
flotation cost for equity (5%) is higher than that of debt (1%)
incorporate the flotation costs into the cost of capital, the cost of external equity is $r_e=\frac{D_1}{P_0-F}+g=\frac{D_1}{P_0(1-f)}+g$
another method is calculation for specific project


<h4>METHODS IN USE</h4>
<!--  -->
mostly use CAPM



<h3>Capital Structure</h3>

<h4>CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND COMPANY LIFE CYCLE</h4>
<!-- 6 -->
<img src="images/CFA-corporate issuer-capital structure-life cycle.png" width="100%"/>

Capital Intensive Businesses with Marketable Assets use high levels of leverage regardless of their development stage, such as real estate, utilities, shipping and airlines
for industry with business cycle, it is harder to find debt financing

<h4>MODIGLIANI–MILLER PROPOSITIONS</h4>
<!--  -->
assumptions: homogeneous expectation, perfect capital market, risk-free rate, no agency costs and independent decisions
<h5>MM Proposition I without taxes</h5>
The market value of a company is not affected by the capital structure of the company.
<h5>MM Proposition II without Taxes</h5>
$r_e=r_0+(r_0-r_d)\frac{D}{E}$
<h5>MM Proposition I with corporate taxes</h5>
$V_L=V_U+tD$
<h5>MM Proposition II with corporate taxes</h5>
$r_e=r_0+(r_0-r_d)(1-t)\frac{D}{E}$

<h4>OPTIMAL AND TARGET CAPITAL STRUCTURE</h4>
<!--  -->
$V_L = V_U + tD − PV(\text{Costs of financial distress})$
optimal capital structure: a point where firm value is maximized
The optimal capital structure minimizes WACC: firm value is PV of free cash flow discounted by WACC

<h4>FACTORS AFFECTING CAPITAL STRUCTURE DECISIONS</h4>
firm tend to issue stock when stock overvalued

<h4>AGENCY COSTS</h4>
the more financially leveraged a company, the less freedom for managers to either take on more debt or unwisely spend cash

<h4>STAKEHOLDER INTERESTS</h4>
<!--  -->
customer and supplier tend to be conservative



<h3>Measures of Leverage</h3>
Leverage is the use of fixed costs in a company’s cost structure

<h4>LEVERAGE</h4>
more fixed costs relative to variable costs, more risk

<h4>BUSINESS RISK</h4>
<!-- 88 -->
business risk = sales risk + operating risk, where
* business risk: risk associated with operating earnings
* sales risk: price and quantity of goods
* operating risk: the use of fixed cost in operations, greater fixed cost, greater risk

<h4>OPERATING LEVERAGE</h4>
<!--  -->
degree of operating leverage (DOL): $\text{DOL}=\frac{\text{% change in operating income}}{\text{% change in units sold}}=\frac{Q(P-V)}{Q(P-V)-F}$
contribution margin: revenue - variable costs
high DOL industry: software and pharmaceutical; low DOL industry: retailer
for company having multiple product, estimate it with regression (operating earning on revenue)
 
<h4>FINANCIAL LEVERAGE</h4>
<!--  -->
financial risk: risk associated with how a company finances its operations
degree of financial leverage (DFL): $\text{DFL}=\frac{\text{% change in net income}}{\text{% change in operating income}}\frac{Q(P-V)-F}{Q(P-V)-F-C}$

<h4>TOTAL LEVERAGE</h4>
degree of total leverage (DTL): $\text{DTL}=\frac{\text{% change in net income}}{\text{% change in units sold}}=DOL\times DFL$

<h4>BREAKEVEN POINTS AND OPERATING BREAKEVEN POINTS</h4>
<!--  -->
$Q_\text{BE}=\frac{F+C}{P-V}$, higher risk, higher breakeven point, higher revenue
$Q_\text{OBE}=\frac{F}{P-V}$

<h4>THE RISKS OF CREDITORS AND OWNERS</h4>
bankruptcy: reorgnization and liquidation
