<h3>DEMAND ANALYSIS</h3>
<!--  -->
law of demand: price increases, buyers buy less; because of substitution effect and income effect (real income increases) 
defmand function: $Q_x^d=f(P_x,I,P_y)$
inverse demand function: $P_x=8.92-0.156Q_x^d$
demand curve: graph of inverse demand function
own-price elasticity of demand: $E_{P_x}^d=\frac{\%\Delta Q_x^d}{\%\Delta P_x}=\frac{\Delta Q_x^d}{\Delta P_x}\frac{P_x}{Q_x^d}$
elastic: $|E_{P_x}^d|>1$; inelastic: $|E_{P_x}|^d< 1$; unitary elastic: $|E_{P_x}^d|=1$
perfectly elastic: individual seller under perfectly competitive market
predictive of elasticity of demand: substitutability, portion of the budget spent on the good, the amount of time to respond to the price change, whether the good is necessary or optional
for seller: increase price under inelasiticity could decrease demand and save total production cost
income elasticity of demand: $E_{I}^d=\frac{\%\Delta Q_x^d}{\%\Delta I}$
normal good: $E_{I}^d>0$; inferior food: $E_{I}^d< 0$
cross-price elasticity of demand: $E_{y}^d=\frac{\%\Delta Q_x^d}{\%\Delta P_y}$
substitutes: $E_{y}^d>0$; complements: $E_{y}^d< 0$
substitute effect is true for both normal and inferior good
Giffen good (inferior good and income effect overwhelms substitute effect): prices increases and demand increases; Veblen good (not inferior good): e.g. luxury good
an method to decompose income effect and substitute effect: Consumer can pay an amount of money to have the privilege to buy good at a lower price, we adjust this privilege price until the consumer is indifferent (same level of utility), and see whether the good demand is increased
<h3>SUPPLY ANALYSIS</h3>
<!--  -->
law of diminishing marginal returns (marginal product decreases with additional input units)
$TC=wL+rK$, $L$ and $K$ are laboring and capital hours (firm seen as renting machines, because of the opportunity cost)
cost function: $C=f(Q)$, production cost for given amount of output
total product, average product, marginal product
economic profit = total revenue (TR) - economic costs
accounting profit = total revenue (TR) - accounting cost
marginal cost consists of short-run marginal cost (SMC) and long-run marginal cost (LMC), $SWC =\frac{w}{MP_L}$
average (on units of output) variable cost (AVC) = $\frac{w}{AP_L}$
total cost (TC) = total fixed cost (TFC) + total variable cost (TVC)
quasi-fixed cost (fixed inside of some range), part of TFC
<!--  -->
A firm is said to break even if its TR is equal to its TC.
Economic costs are the sum of total accounting costs and implicit opportunity costs.
A firm whose revenue is equal to its economic costs is covering the opportunity cost of all of its factors of production, including capital. Economists would say that such a firm is earning normal profit, but not positive economic profit. It is earning a rate of return on capital just equal to the rate of return that an investor could expect to earn in an equivalently risky alternative investment (opportunity cost).
In the long run, the best a firm can do is to break even because of other entrants.

In the example of TC, opportunity of the asset is reflected in the MVC (return of asset) and TC (could have sold the machine)?

LRAC curve is an envelope curve of SATC curve:

The minimum point on the LRAC curve is referred to as the minimum efficient scale. The minimum efficient scale is the optimal firm size under perfect competition over the long run.
<h3>MARKET STRUCTURES ANALYSIS</h3>
<!--  -->
perfect competition, monopolistic competition (cola, cosmetics), oligopoly, and monopoly
five factors determine market structure:
* The number and relative size of firms supplying the product;
* The degree of product differentiation;
* The power of the seller over pricing decisions;
* The relative strength of the barriers to market entry and exit;
* The degree of non-price competition.

$ε_P = –\frac{\%\Delta Q_x^d}{\%\Delta P_x}$
Consumer surplus is defined as the difference between the value that a consumer places on the units purchased and the amount of money that was required to pay for them. Demand curve can therefore be considered a marginal value curve
<h4>OLIGOPOLY</h4>
There are three basic pricing strategies: pricing interdependence (price war), the Cournot assumption, and the Nash equilibrium
pricing interdependence: DD is the demand curve when all participants make the same move, dd is the demand curve when only one participant make that move, which explains the price stability, but not the initial price:
<img src="images/cfa-economics-market structure-kinked curve.jpg" width="100%"/>
In long run, market share is temporary.
<h4>COURNOT</h4>
In the Cournot assumption, each firm determines its profit-maximizing production level by assuming that the other firms’ output will not change
<h4>NASH EQUILIBRIUM</h4>
<!-- -->
formal price collusion is called cartel, 6 factors:
* The number and size distribution of sellers
* The similarity of the products
* Cost structure
* Order size and frequency
* The strength and severity of retaliation
* The degree of external competition
<h4>STACKELBERG MODEL</h4>
the leader firm chooses its output first and then the follower firm chooses after observing the leader’s output
<h3>MONOPOLY</h3>
<!--  -->
factors: patent/copyright, control over critical resources, government-controlled authorization (because of the significant entry cost), brand loyalty and Network effects (result from synergies related to increasing market penetration)
*besides quantity and price, monopolist can also adjust the quality
<h3>PRICE DISCRIMINATION</h3>
<!--  -->
first degree: perfect
second degree: quantity-based
third degree: customer-based
<h3>IDENTIFICATION OF MARKET STRUCTURE</h3>
<!--  -->
econometric: regression
concentration ratio
Herfindahl–Hirschman index (HHI): square of the market share
<h2>Macroeconomics</h2>
<h3>AGGREGATE OUTPUT AND INCOME</h3>
<h4>GDP</h4>
<!-- 120 -->
aggregate output = aggregate income = aggregate expenditure (the total amount spent on the goods and services produced)
in the (domestic) economy during the period
for simplicity, it is standard in macroeconomics to attribute all income to the household sector, because government is non-profit
Gross domestic product (GDP) measures:
* the market value of all final goods and services produced within the economy during a given period (output definition) or, equivalently,
* the aggregate income earned by all households, all companies, and the government within the economy during a given period (income definition).
<!--  -->
GDP criterion:
* All goods and services included in the calculation of GDP must be produced during the measurement period, excluding unemployment compensation and appreciation of asset
* those whose value can be determined by being sold in the market, excluding gardening and commuting (*two examples, government service, at cost and owner-occupied housing (easy to calculate, compared to self gardening), are included in GDP)
* Only the market value of final goods and services is included in GDP, excluding intermediate good
  
Nominal $\text{GDP}_t=P_tQ_t$; real $\text{GDP}_t=P_BQ_t$, $P_B$ is price in the base years
GDP deflator=Nominal GDP/Real GDP*100
$\begin{aligned}\text{GDP}&=C+I+G+(X−M)\\
&=(C+G_C)+(I+G_I)+(X−M)\end{aligned}$
A trade deficit must be funded by a capital inflow.
<h4>GDI</h4>
<!--  -->
GDP = Gross domestic income (GDI) = Net domestic income + Consumption of fixed capital (CFC) + Statistical discrepancy
$\begin{aligned}
\text{GDP} &= \text{Consumer spending on goods and services}\\
&+\text{Business gross fixed investment}\\
&+\text{Change in inventories}\\
&+\text{Government spending on goods and services}\\
&+\text{Government gross fixed investment}\\
&+\text{Exports Imports}\\
&+\text{Statistical discrepancy}\end{aligned}$
$\begin{aligned}
\text{GDI}&= \text{Compensation of employees}\\
&+\text{Gross operating surplus}\\
&+\text{Gross mixed income(farm, nonfarm, rent)}\\
&+\text{Taxes less subsidies on production}\\
&+\text{Taxes less subsidies on products and imports}\end{aligned}$
Personal income (household primary income) = Compensation of employees + Net mixed income + Net property income
<h4>Relationship among Saving, Investment, the Fiscal Balance and the Trade Balance</h4>
<!--  -->
$Y+F-S_B-R=C+S_H$, where $Y$ is GDP, $F$ is transfer payment, $R$ is tax, $S_B$ is business saving
$\rightarrow$ $Y=C+S+T=C+(S_H+S_B)+(R-F)$
$\rightarrow$ $S=I+(G-T)+(X-M)$
$\rightarrow$ $(G-T)=(S-I)-(X-M)$
$C=C(Y-S_B-T)\approx C(Y-T)$
marginal propensity to consume, marginal propensity to save
average propensity to consume (APC), C/Y, is a good proxy for MPC
$I = I(r, Y)$, decreasing in real interest rate $r$ and increasing in GDP
$G-T=\overline{G}-t(Y)$, where $G$ is an exogenous policy and to some extent, $T$ depends on economic need
<h3>AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY</h3>
<h4>AGGREGATE DEMAND</h4>
<!--  -->
aggregate demand curve slopes downward because of:
* wealth effect
* interest rate effect: higher interest rate decreases investment demand and affect consumption (mainly large purchases)
* real exchange rate effect: internation good as substitutes; price increases, interest rate increas and then domestic currency appreciates
  
price as dependent variable in this model, moves along the aggregate demand curve
<h4>AGGREGATE SUPPLY</h4>
<!--  -->
The “long run” here is long enough that wages, prices, and expectations can adjust but not long enough that physical capital is a variable input. So $Y=F(\overline{K},\overline{L})=\overline{Y}$

Shift in AD curve:
* Household Wealth: higher equity price makes it easier for household to achieve its wealth accumlation goals and increase consumption
* Consumer and Business Expectations
* Capacity Utilization: higher capacity, more investment and AD curve shifts to right
* Fiscal policy
* monetary policy: more money, lower interest rate, household will purchase durable good, credit limit will be raised and credit standard will be loosened
* exchange rate
* Growth in the Global Economy

higer consumption implies higher equity price

Shift in AS curve:
* Change in Nominal Wages: nominal wage increases, SRAS shifts to left, LRAS does not change
