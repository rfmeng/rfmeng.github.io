<h3>Inventories</h3>
<!-- 254 -->
raw materials,work in progress, and finished goods, report separately or in total amount


<h4>Cost</h4>
<!--  -->
all cost
trade discounts or rebates reduce the price paid
direct labor, variable overhead cost are also cost, the expense will be recognized only when inventory are sold
recognized as expense in the same period:
* abnormal costs incurred as a result of waste
* storage cost(unless required by production process)
* administrative cost
transportation cost for raw material need not be separated for abnormal waste


<h4>Valuation methods</h4>
<!--  -->
When items are sold, the carrying amount of inventory is recognised as an expense
Specific Identification (个别计价法): such as precious gemstones

<h4>Periodic versus perpetual inventory systems</h4>
定期盘存制, 永续盘存制

<h4>Lifo reserve</h4>
<!-- to 261, owe 120 -->
US GAAP requires LIFO reserve, which is the FIFO inventory value less the LIFO inventory value
$L_1-L_0+C_L=F_1-F_0+C_F$

<h4>Lifo liquidations</h4>
<!--  -->
in periods rising inventory cost, if the inventory units declines, there will be a LIFO liquidation where an unsustainable higher profit occurs
gross profit due to LIFO liquidation could be determined by:  number of units liquidated * the difference between the replacement cost of the units liquidated and their historical purchase cost

<h4>Method changes</h4>
GAAP: when changing to LIFO, no retrospective adjustment, the carrying amount becomes the initial LIFO layer

<h4>Adjustments</h4>
<!-- 275 -->
IFRS: 
* lower of cost and Net realisable value
* the loss (reduction in value) recognised as an expense on income statement, in cost of sales or reported separately*
* the reversal of write-down is recongnized as reduction in cost of sales

GAAP: 
* lower of cost and market value (current replacement cost, which should be higher than net realisable value - normal profit margin, lower than net realisable value)
* prohibit the reversal of write-down

for agricultrual/forest/mineral products, NRV or mark-to-market are used, changes are recognized p&l
FIFO methods are more likely to incur inventory write-downs than LIFO

inventory obsolete allowance, reported on balance sheet immediately below asset account to show net reported value:
> Dr: expense
> Cr: inventory write down allowance


<h4>Evaluation of inventory management: disclosures & ratios</h4>
US GAAP requires to report the liquidation of LIFO inventory
raw material and work-in-progress reflected firm's expectation toward future demand


<!-- ILLUSTRATIONS OF INVENTORY ANALYSIS: ADJUSTING LIFO TO FIFO -->
<!-- 288 -->
<h3>Long-lived assets</h3>
<!-- 322 -->
long-lived assets, typically over a year, include tangible, intangible and financial assets
<h4>Acquisition of property, plant and equipment</h4>
<!--  -->
land and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
initial carrying amount: cost, typically similar to fair value
in assets exchange: fair value, if not appliable, then carrying amount of the asset given up
cost recognition: all the expenditures necessary to get the asset ready for its intended use
when constructing an asset, borrow cost is capitalized; under IFRS but not GAAP, investing income of the money could decrease cost
capitalized interest is investing cash flow, expensed interest subject to accounting standard
under capitalization, depreciation is investment outflow; under expense, it is operating outflow

<h4>Acquisition of intangible assets</h4>
<!--  -->
* purchased in situations other than business combinations
* developed internally
  IFRS: development expenditures could be capitalized
  GAAP: all expenditure should be expensed except for software developments, similar to IFRS
* acquired in business combinations: 
  goodwill = purchase price - fair value 

goodwill is not identifiable intangible asset (see before)
<h4>Capitalisation of interest costs</h4>
<!-- 335 -->
the ture interest coverage ratio should be calculated by gross interest

<h4>Capitalisation of interest and internal development costs</h4>

<h4>Depreciation of long-lived assets</h4>
<!--  -->
IFRS permits revaluation model (fair value), but GAAP not
three methods:
* straight-line method
* accelerated method: use carrying amount to calculate depreciation, but not lower than estimated residual value
* units-of-production method

In U.S., depreciation method for financial reporting and tax may be different, which draw defered tax
IFRS require a component method of depreciation
all methods should have the same residual value when useful life ends

<h4>Amortisation </h4>
for intangible assets

<h4>Revaluation model</h4>
<!--  -->
carrying amounts are the fair values at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation or amortisation
revaluation model may be used for intangible assets but only if an active market exists
revaluation surplus account to hold the excess value, transfered directly to retained earnings, appear in other comprehensive income

<h4>Impairment of assets</h4>
<!-- 357 -->
IFRS permits impairment reversal, but GAAP not
impairment:
* IFRS: recoverable amount = the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use; impairment = carrying amount - recoverable amount
* GAAP: carrying amount is not recoverable when it exceeds undiscounted expected future cash flow; impairment = carrying amount - fair value

Intangibles with Indefinite Lives: fair value
Long-Lived Assets Held for Sale: fair value less costs to sell
Reversals of Impairments of Long-Lived Assets:
| |  IFRS   | GAAP  |
|-|  ----  | ----  |
| held for use | permitted  | not permiteed |
| held for sale| permitted  | permiteed |

asset impairment is an entry on income statement
<h4>Derecognition</h4>
sale
disposal other than sale: carrying amount - fair value of assets given up
spin-off (让产易股)
<h4>Presentation and disclosure requirements</h4>
???

<h4>Using disclosures in analysis</h4>
<!-- 370, owe 147 -->
Estimated total useful life = historical cost / annual depreciation expense
<h4>Investment property</h4>
<!--  -->
Investment property: held for rental or asset appreciation
IFRS permits cost model and fair value model where fair value model is different from revaluation model, reflecting all profit and loss in income statement
from owner-occupied to investment property: treated like a revaluation; from inventory to investment property: like fair value
if use fair value model, it should be kept even if market is not active any longer

<h3>Income taxes???</h3>
<!-- 398 -->
accounting profit (income before taxes or pretax income)
<h4>Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities</h4>
tax expense = income tax payable + change in defered tax liability



<h4>Changes in income tax rates</h4>

<h3>Non-current (long-term) liabilities</h3>
<!-- 436 -->
bond: maturity longer than 10 years; note maturity between 2 years and 10 years; bill: maturity shorter than 2 years
<h4>Accounting for bond issuance</h4>
<!--  -->
market rate of interest: discounting rate for bond price
effective interest rate: market rate at the time of issuance
bonds payable: sale proceeds
IFRS treat issuance costs as bonds payable while GAAP treats it as an asset (defered charge)
<h4>Accounting for bond amortisation, interest expense, and interest payments</h4>
<!--  -->
IFRS requires effective rate method; GAAP prefers it 
straight line method: the discount is evenly amortised
amortisation is non-cash and added back to net profit when preparing operating cash flow


<h4>Accounting for bonds at fair value</h4>
<!-- 446 -->
fair value model enters profit and loss
fair value disclosures are required
the portion of the change in value attributable to changes in their credit risk is reported in other comprehensive income

<h4>Derecognition of debt</h4>
gain or loss on the extinguishment of debt is on the income statement

<h4>Debt covenants</h4>

<h4>Leases</h4>
<!--  -->
for a contract to be a lease:
* a specific asset 
* customer (lessee) to obtain largely benefits
* customer to direct how to use

A lease that resembles a purchase is classified as a finance lease; All other leases are operating leases
a lease is financial lease if any of the conditions below is satisfied:
* transfer of ownership
* lessee has option to buy and it will do so
* lease term is for a major part of the asset's useful life
* present value of total payments higher than that of the asset
* underlying asset has no alternative use for lessor

If its term is 12 months or less (IFRS and US GAAP) or it is for a “low-value asset,” up to $5,000 in sales price (IFRS only), then the lessee can elect to simply expense the lease payments on a straight-line basis

<h5>Lessee accounting - ifrs</h5>
<!--  -->
At lease inception, a lease payable liability and "right of use" ROU asset
lease liability is reported like a bond
ROU is reported on a straight-line basis
principal repayment is financing cash flow

<h5>Lessee accounting - gaap</h5>
<!--  -->
Financing lease is same as IFRS
Operating lease: ROU is reported similar to lease liability
the entire lease payment is operating cash flow

<h5>Lessor accounting</h5>
<!--  -->
finance lease: lease receivable and interest revenue (total cash receipt is reported as operating cash flow)
operating lease: treated like operating activity

<h4>Pensions and other post-employment benefits</h4>
<!--  -->
defined contribution pension plans: defined amount payment

included in salary or cost of sale
<h5>IFRS</h5>
<!--  -->
employee's service cost and net interest expense or income are recognized as profit and loss
remeasurements is recognized in other comprehensive income, not amortised:
* acturial gain and loss (mortality rate)
* actual return on plan assets - corresponding interest expense
<h5>GAAP</h5>
<!--  -->
profit and loss: service cost, interest expense and expected return
other comprehensive income: past service cost and remeasurements

<h3>Financial reporting quality</h3>
<!-- 491 -->
financial report quality and earnings (result) quality
<h4>Biased accounting choices</h4>
<!--  -->
aggressive, conservative and understatement of earning volatility
non-GAAP financail meassure disclosure: equal prominence and reconciliation

<h4>Differentiate between conservative and aggressive accounting</h4>
<h5>Conservatism in accounting standards</h5>
<!--  -->
Examples:
* research cost: expensed under both IFRS and GAAP
* litigation loss: recognized when probable
* insurance recoverable: not recognized until insurance company acknowledges

Critical Accounting Estimates should be disclosed in MDA (management discuss and analysis) against potential report bias

<h4>Detection of financial reporting quality issues: introduction & presentation choices</h4>
<!--  -->
The SEC prohibits the exclusion of charges or liabilities requiring cash settlement from any non-GAAP liquidity measures, other than EBIT and EBITDA
The SEC views the period within two years of either before or after the reporting date for considering whether a charge or gain is recurring
motivation, opportunity and rationality
<h4>Affect earnings and balance sheets</h4>
<!--  -->
* free on board (FOB) shipping point and free on board destination
* inventory valuation method
* allowance for uncollectible accounts
* valuation allowance for defered tax asset
* depreciation method
* capitalization or expense
<h4>Affect cash flow statment</h4>
<!--  -->
* delay payment of account payable
* misclassify operating uses of cash into either the investing or financing sections

<h3>Financial reporting quality</h3>
<!-- 491 -->


<h4>Application: assessing credit risk</h4>
<!--  -->
focus more on cash flow rather accual income
<h4>Screening for potential equity investments</h4>
<!--  -->
reduce a set of potential investments to a smaller set having certain desired characteristics
growth investors, value investors and market-oriented investors
back-testing limitations:
* survivorship bias
* look-ahead bias: financial data updated for restatements
* data-snooping bias: solved by data split into test and train


<h4>Adjustments related to property, plant and equipment</h4>
capex: capital expenditure
