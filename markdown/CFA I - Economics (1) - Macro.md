<h3>Aggregate output and income</h3>
<h4>GDP</h4>
<!-- 120 -->
aggregate output = aggregate income = aggregate expenditure (the total amount spent on the goods and services produced)
in the (domestic) economy during the period
for simplicity, it is standard in macroeconomics to attribute all income to the household sector, because government is non-profit
Gross domestic product (GDP) measures:
* the market value of all final goods and services produced within the economy during a given period (output definition) or, equivalently,
* the aggregate income earned by all households, all companies, and the government within the economy during a given period (income definition).
<!--  -->
GDP criterion:
* All goods and services included in the calculation of GDP must be produced during the measurement period, excluding unemployment compensation and appreciation of asset
* those whose value can be determined by being sold in the market, excluding gardening and commuting (*two examples, government service, at cost and owner-occupied housing (easy to calculate, compared to self gardening), are included in GDP)
* Only the market value of final goods and services is included in GDP, excluding intermediate good
  
Nominal $\text{GDP}_t=P_tQ_t$; real $\text{GDP}_t=P_BQ_t$, $P_B$ is price in the base years
GDP deflator=Nominal GDP/Real GDP*100
$\begin{aligned}\text{GDP}&=C+I+G+(X−M)\\
&=(C+G_C)+(I+G_I)+(X−M)\end{aligned}$
A trade deficit must be funded by a capital inflow.
<h4>GDI</h4>
<!--  -->
GDP = Gross domestic income (GDI) = Net domestic income + Consumption of fixed capital (CFC) + Statistical discrepancy
$\begin{aligned}
\text{GDP} &= \text{Consumer spending on goods and services}\\
&+\text{Business gross fixed investment}\\
&+\text{Change in inventories}\\
&+\text{Government spending on goods and services}\\
&+\text{Government gross fixed investment}\\
&+\text{Exports Imports}\\
&+\text{Statistical discrepancy}\end{aligned}$
$\begin{aligned}
\text{GDI}&= \text{Compensation of employees}\\
&+\text{Gross operating surplus}\\
&+\text{Gross mixed income(farm, nonfarm, rent)}\\
&+\text{Taxes less subsidies on production}\\
&+\text{Taxes less subsidies on products and imports}\end{aligned}$
Personal income (household primary income) = Compensation of employees + Net mixed income + Net property income
<h4>Relationship among saving, investment, the fiscal balance and the trade balance</h4>
<!--  -->
$Y+F-S_B-R=C+S_H$, where $Y$ is GDP, $F$ is transfer payment, $R$ is tax, $S_B$ is business saving
$\rightarrow$ $Y=C+S+T=C+(S_H+S_B)+(R-F)$
$\rightarrow$ $S=I+(G-T)+(X-M)$
$\rightarrow$ $(G-T)=(S-I)-(X-M)$
$C=C(Y-S_B-T)\approx C(Y-T)$
marginal propensity to consume, marginal propensity to save
average propensity to consume (APC), C/Y, is a good proxy for MPC
$I = I(r, Y)$, decreasing in real interest rate $r$ and increasing in GDP
$G-T=\overline{G}-t(Y)$, where $G$ is an exogenous policy and to some extent, $T$ depends on economic need
<h3>Aggregate demand and aggregate supply</h3>
<h4>Aggregate demand</h4>
<!--  -->
aggregate demand curve slopes downward because of:
* wealth effect
* interest rate effect: higher interest rate decreases investment demand and affect consumption (mainly large purchases)
* real exchange rate effect: internation good as substitutes; price increases, interest rate increas and then domestic currency appreciates
  
price as dependent variable in this model, moves along the aggregate demand curve
<h4>Aggregate supply</h4>
<!--  -->
The “long run” here is long enough that wages, prices, and expectations can adjust but not long enough that physical capital is a variable input. So $Y=F(\overline{K},\overline{L})=\overline{Y}$

Shift in AD curve:
* Household Wealth: higher equity price makes it easier for household to achieve its wealth accumlation goals and increase consumption
* Consumer and Business Expectations
* Capacity Utilization: higher capacity, more investment and AD curve shifts to right
* Fiscal policy
* monetary policy: more money, lower interest rate, household will purchase durable good, credit limit will be raised and credit standard will be loosened
* exchange rate
* Growth in the Global Economy

higer consumption implies higher equity price
<!-- 149 -->
Shift in SRAS curve:
* Change in Nominal Wages: nominal wage increases, SRAS shifts to left, LRAS does not change
* Change in Input Prices
* Change in Expectations about Future Prices
* Change in Business Taxes and Subsidies
* Change in the Exchange Rate: domestic currency appreciates, material from other countries cheaper

Shift in LRAS curve:
* supply of labor and quality of labor forces (human capital),
* supply of natural resources,
* supply of physical capital, and
* productivity and technology.
<h4>Equilibrium GDP and prices</h4>
<!--  -->
4 types of macroeconomic equilibrium:
* long-run equilibrium
* short-run recessionary gap
  under this situation, invest less in cyclical companies (automobile and chemical) and more in defensive companies (food and pharmeceutical)
<p class="wrapper" style="text-align:center;">
<img src="images/CFA I/CFA I-economics-macro-recessionary gap.png" width="450px" max-width="100%" align="center"></p>

* short-run inflationary gap
<p class="wrapper" style="text-align:center;">
<img src="images/CFA I/CFA I-economics-macro-inflationary gap.png" width="450px" max-width="100%" align="center"></p>

* short-run stagflation

<h4>Economic growth and sustainability</h4>
<!-- 199 -->
**sustainable rate of economic growth** : the rate of increase in the economy’s productive capacity or potential GDP (LRAS).
<h5>Solow's model</h5>
<!--  -->
production function: $Y=AF(L,K)$, where $A$ is total factor productivity and could not be directly observed, but instead eastimated; it is a redisual effect.
assumption:
* $tAF(L,K)=AF(tL,tK)$
* diminishing marginal productivity for any input solely
* no externalities for input

there should be a convergence of incomes between developed and developing countires over time.
Growth in potential GDP = Growth in TFP + $W_L$ (Growth in labor) + $W_C$ (Growth in capital)
Growth in per capita potential GDP = Growth in TFP +
$W_C$ (Growth in capital-to-laborratio)
<p class="wrapper" style="text-align:center;">
<img src="images/CFA I/CFA I-economics-macro-economic growth.png" width="500px" max-width="100%" align="center"></p>
$A$ concludes: human capital (quality of labor), technology, natural resources, public infrastructure, pollution, economic environment (legal and political)
$Y/L=AF(1,K/L)$, where $Y/L$ = Labor productivity = Real GDP/Aggregate hours
Potential GDP = Aggregate hours worked × Labor productivity $\Rightarrow$ Potential growth rate = Long-term growth rate of aggregate hours worked +
Long-term labor productivity growth rate


<h3>Business cycles</h3>
<!-- 199 -->
business cycles rely mainly on business enterprises—therefore, not agrarian societies or centrally planned economies.
Types of cycles:
* classical cycle: peak and trough
* growth cycle (which CFA use)
* growth rate cycle
  <p class="wrapper" style="text-align:center;">

Four phases: recovery, expansion, slow down and contraction
equity market is a leading indicator of the economy
recession: Real GDP has two consecutive quarters of negative growth
<h4>Credit cycles</h4>
<!--  -->
business cycles can be amplified because of finance cycle
monetary and fiscal policy traditionally concentrate on reducing the volatility of business cycles
<h4>Different persepctives</h4>
<!--  -->
Firm:
* Employment
* capital spending: first light equipment, then heavy equipment
* Inventory

household:
* consumpytion: durable good > service > non-durable, in cyclical order
* income: durables move with disposable income, while service tracks permanant income (excludes sudden loss and gain)

Housing sector: late buying (like equity)
External trade sector
<h4>Theoretical consideration</h4>
<!--  -->
Neoclassical Economics, (RBC (real business cycle)):
* monetary and fiscal policy has lags/delays, amplifying the cycle
* invisible hand results from the utility maximization
* provide better information for market participants to allow price and production to adjust in time

The Austrian School:
* stress monetary policy
* markets are flexible and prices are easy to adjust, supply curve (even short run) is actually steep
* policy maker should not intervene

Monetarism:
* money supply needs to grow at a moderate rate
* business cycle results from exogenous shock and   government intervention, policy should be clear to decrease uncertainty for market participants

Keynesianism:
* government should intervene more on fiscal policy, because confidence might be low
* nominal wage is sticky and supply curve is flat
* in the long run, we are all dead 

Minsky moment: When he looks down and sees that he is walking on thin air, he panics and falls to the bottom of the canyon
<h4>Indicator</h4>
<p class="wrapper" style="text-align:center;">
<img src="images/CFA I/CFA I-economics-macro-indicator.png" width="650px" max-width="100%" align="center"></p>
<h4>Unemployment</h4>
<!--  -->
Labor force = employed + unemployed (who are seeking jobs), unemployed consists of long-term unemployed and frictionally unemployed
unemployment rate = unemployed/labor force
participation rate = labor force/working age
underemployed
discouraged worker: those who stopped looking for a job
<h4>Inflation</h4>
<!--  -->
deflation, hyperinflation and disinflation (slowdown inflation)
hyperinfaltion has a vicious circle like machanism (price increases, people are eager to change money into real good)
price index: fisher index = sqrt of (Laspeyres index (old basket) and Paasche index (new basket))
Laspeyres index's biases: substitution bias, quality bias and new product bias
CPI (consumer price index) and PPI (producer price index)
headline inflation (all goods) and core inflation (except food and energy), core inflation is to exclude the effect of short term changes
cost push (wage) inflation and demand pull inflation
non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) (effective index before unemployment reaches low levels)
unit labor cost (ULC) = output per hour per worker/total labor compensation per hour per worker
