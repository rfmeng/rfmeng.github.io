<h1>Equity Investments (1)</h1>
<h3>Market Organization and Structure</h3>
<h4>THE FUNCTIONS OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM</h4>
<!-- 122 -->
Determining equilibrium rate is one of the most important functions of the financial system.
allocationally efficient: allocate capital to those uses that are most productive

<h4>ASSETS AND CONTRACTS</h4>
<!-- 130 -->
classification:
* securities: debt, equity and pool investment vehichle (ETF)
* currencies
* contracts
* commodities: precious metals, energy products, industrial metals, and agricultural products
* real assets

money market: debt instruments maturing in one year or less; capital markets: other instruments
traditional investment markets: publicly traded debts and equities and shares in pooled investment vehicles; alternative investment markets: all other investments, such as hedge fund

<h4>SECURITIES</h4>
<!--  -->
stock warrant (right to buy a security) is equity security
pooled investments: mutual fund (shares), trust (units), hedge fund (limited partnership interests) and depositories(depositary receipt) 
Many ETFs permit only in-kind deposits and redemptions
closed-end fund: not allow redemption

<h4>CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES, AND REAL ASSETS</h4>
real assets are attractive because of tax benefits and low correlation with other investments

<h4>CONTRACTS</h4>
<!--  -->
forward: counterparty risk and liquidity 
futures: initial margin and maintainance margin, margin call to add margin to initial margin
option holder and option writer
CDS (Credit default swaps): payment of principal when company defaults on its bond

<h4>FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES</h4>
<!-- 145 -->
broker: fill order for client
Alternative trading systems (ATSs), also known as electronic communications networks (ECNs) or multilateral trading facilities (MTFs): dark pool
dealer: fill order by trading with client
Almost all investment banks have large dealing operations

<!-- 162 -->
|instructions||
|-|-|
|Execution instructions|how to fill the order|
|validity instructions| when the order may be filled|

<h4>PRIMARY SECURITY MARKETS</h4>
<!--  -->
book building: IPO preparation process
underwritten offering (承销发行): bank will buy securities that not sold; best effort offering: investment bank act only as a broker
IPO price tends to be low because issuer does not want a unsubscribed IPO

<h4>WELL-FUNCTIONING FINANCIAL SYSTEMS</h4>
<!--  -->
operationally efficient: low trading cost
informationally efficient: the prices reflect all available fundamental information


<h3>Market Organization and Structure</h3>
<h4>INDEX CONSTRUCTION</h4>
<!--  -->
$V_{PRI}=\frac{1}{D}\sum n_iP_i$
$PR_I=\sum{w_iPR_i}$
$TR_I=\sum{w_iTR_i}=\sum{w_i\frac{P_{1i}-P_{0i}+Inc_i}{P_{0i}}}$
$V_{PRIT} = V_{PRI0}\prod_{t=1}^{T}{(1+PR_{It})}$
$V_{TRIT} = V_{TRI0}\prod_{t=1}^{T}{(1+PR_{It})}$
Weighting: price weighting, Equal Weighting (need rebalancing), Market-Capitalization Weighting (float-adjusted market-capitalization weighting) and fundamental weighting: value tilt, which means ratios of book value to market value that are higher than its arket-capitalization-weighted counterpart

<h4>EQUITY INDEXES</h4>
<!--  -->
broad market index
multi-market index
sector index
style index: small/large cap index, value/growth index,

<h4>FIXED-INCOME INDEXES</h4>
<!--  -->

<h4>INDEXES FOR ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS</h4>
<!--  -->
commodity index: future price rather than commodity price
real estate: appraisal indexes, repeat sales indexes, and real estate investment trust (REIT) indexes


<h3>Market Efficiency</h3>
<!-- 235 -->
Active returns: returns earned by strategies taking advantage of market ineffciency

<h4>THE CONCEPT OF MARKET EFFICIENCY</h4>
<!--  -->
passive investment: broad market portfolio

<h4>FACTORS AFFECTING MARKET EFFICIENCY INCLUDING TRADING COSTS</h4>
<!--  -->
the number of the market participants
Information Availability and fair access to information
Limits to Trading: such as short selling limitation
Transaction Costs and Information-Acquisition Costs 

<h4>FORMS OF MARKET EFFICIENCY</h4>
<!--  -->
Weak form: past market data
semi-strong form: public information
strong form: private information

<h4>MARKET PRICING ANOMALIES - TIME SERIES AND CROSS-SECTIONAL</h4>
<!--  -->
Time-Series Anomalies:
* calendar anomaly: higher January return, day-of-the-week
* Momentum
* Overreaction Anomalies: people overreact to news, buing loser stock and selling winner stock will gain abnormal return

Cross-Sectional Anomalies:
* size effect: small cap companies have higher return
* value effect: low P/B ratio companies have higher return

<h4>OTHER ANOMALIES, IMPLICATIONS OF MARKET PRICING ANOMALIES</h4>
<!--  -->
Closed-End Investment Fund Discounts
Earnings Surprise: adjustment is still happening after news is published

<h4>BEHAVIORAL FINANCE</h4>
<!--  -->
Pricing model usually assumes the market is rational, rather than that every individual is rational
behavior includes:
* loss aversion: the extent of disliking loss exceeds that of liking gains
* herding
* Overconfidence
* Information Cascades

<h3>Overview of Equity Securities</h3>
<h4>CHARACTERISTICS OF EQUITY SECURITIES</h4>
<!-- 280 -->
Common Shares:
* statutory voting: when electing board member, one vote for one director
* cumulative voting: votes (from other directors) can be used on a single director

Preference Shares：cumulative and non-cumulative, Participating and no-participating (whether share company's profit)
Convertible preference shares (convertible to common share)

<h4>PRIVATE VERSUS PUBLIC EQUITY SECURITIES</h4>
<!--  -->
venture capital: exit return when company goes public
leveraged buyout, management buyout
private investment in public equity

<h4>NON-DOMESTIC EQUITY SECURITIES</h4>
<!--  -->
depositary receipt

unsponsored DR: depositary bank retains voting right
global depositary receipt: cannot be traded in America
American depository receipt and American depository share
Global Registered Share

<h4>RISK AND RETURN CHARACTERISTICS</h4>
<!--  -->
dividend reinvestment is important and significant
when company is liquidated, preference shareholder will receive the fixed par value
Callable common or preference shares: the issuer has the option to redeem the shares at a pre-determined price

<h4>EQUITY AND COMPANY VALUE</h4>
<!---->
ROE
blue chip stock: large market capitalization and leaders in their industry
the company’s cost of equity may be different from the investors’ minimum required rate of return on equity, but that will be relected in the price
The ultimate goal of management is to increase the book value (shareholders’ equity on a company’s balance sheet) of the company and maximize the market value of its equity.


<h3>Introduction to Industry and Company Analysis</h3>
<h4>USES OF INDUSTRY ANALYSIS</h4>
<!--  -->
industry rotation strategy: timing investments in industries in relation to an analysis of industry fundamentals and/or business-cyclecondition

<h4>APPROACHES TO IDENTIFYING SIMILAR COMPANIES</h4>
sector consists of industries
<h5>Products and/or Services Supplied</h5>
<!-- 309 -->
principal business activity: source from which company derives a majority of its revenues
<h5>Business-Cycle Sensitivities</h5>
<!--  -->
whether correlated with the overall economy
cyclical industry: autos, housing, basic materials, industrials, and technology
non-cyclical industry: food and beverage, health care and utility
<h5>Statistical Similarities</h5>
based on correlation of return

<h4>INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS</h4>
<!--  -->
commercial classification system usually only include public for-profit companies
peer group

<h4>PRINCIPLES OF STRATEGIC ANALYSIS</h4>
<!--  -->
Porter's 5 force: 
* intra-industry rivalry
* bargaining power of supplier
* bargaining power of customer
* threat of new entrants
* threat of new substitutes
<h5>Barriers to Entry</h5>
<!--  -->
look history participants to identify barrier
affect pricing power, but higher barrier does not guarantee high pricing power, high quit cost results in overcapacity
<h5>Industry Concentration</h5>
<!--  -->
use HHI, sum of square of market fraction
correlates to pricing power but not determinant
<h5>Industry Capacity</h5>
tighter capacity, higher pricing power
<h5>Market Share Stability</h5>
<h5>Price Competition</h5>
<!--  -->
industry where price weighs heavily in the purchase of customer has more fierce price competition
capital intensive industry like auto has low pricing power because of easily found substitutes
<h5>Industry Life Cycle</h5>
<!--  -->
stages:
* embryonic: high price due to lack of economy of scale
* growth: lowest entry barrier, increasing income reduce need of market capital
* shakeout: slowing growth rate, profitability starts to decline
* mature: little or no growth
* decline: technological substitution or competition decreases the demand

the cycle of industry is little predictive under change

<h4>EXTERNAL INFLUENCES ON INDUSTRY</h4>
<!-- 337 -->
Macroeconomic, technological, Demographic (population age), governmental, social (how people consume), environmental (greenhouse gas effect drives customer in livestock away) 

<h4>COMPANY ANALYSIS</h4>
<!--  -->
Company analysis includes financial position anlysis, products and/or services anlysis, and competitive strategy anlysis
Low-cost strategy: low price at some stage for market share
Differentiation strategies: 

<h3>Equity Valuation: Concepts and Basic Tools</h3>
<h4>CATEGORIES OF EQUITY VALUATION MODELS</h4>
<!-- 364 -->
Present value models (or discounted cash flow models): dividend discount models and free-cash-flow-to-equity models
Multiplier models: Enterprise value (EV) multiples have the form (Enterprise value)/(Value of a fundamental variable)
Asset-based valuation models

<h4>BACKGROUND FOR THE DIVIDEND DISCOUNT MODEL</h4>
<!--  -->
extra/special dividend: irregular dividend
stock dividend (bonus issue of shares): stock as dividend
share repurchase is viewed as equivalent to the payment of cash dividends of equal value
declaration date, ex-dividend rate, holder-of-record rate and payment date: price falls on ex-dividend rate

<h4>DIVIDEND DISCOUNT MODEL (DDM) AND FREE-CASH-FLOW-TO-EQUITY MODEL (FCFE)</h4>
<!-- rushing mark -->
dividend discount model: $V_0=\sum\frac{D_t}{(1+r)^t}+\frac{P_n}{(1+r)^n}$
free-cash-flow-to-equity: FCFE = CFO – FCInv + Net borrowing and $V_0=\sum\frac{\text{FCFE}_t}{(1+r)^t}$

<h4>PREFERRED STOCK VALUATION</h4>
for non-callable,non-convertible preferred stock: $V_0=\frac{D_0}{r}$

<h4>THE GORDON GROWTH MODEL</h4>
<!--  -->
the Gordon model assumes Dividends are the correct metric to use for valuation purposes
$V_0=\sum\frac{D_0(1+g)^t}{(1+r)^t}=\frac{D_0(1+g)}{r-g}$
$g=b\times ROE$, where $b$ is earnings retention rate = (1 – Dividend payout ratio)

<h4>MULTISTAGE DIVIDEND DISCOUNT MODELS</h4>
<!--  -->
two stage: an initial finite high growth period $n$ with a long sustainable period
$V_0=\sum_{t=1}^{n}\frac{D_0(1+g_S)^t}{(1+r)^t}+\frac{V_n}{(1+r)^n}$
$V_n=\frac{D_{n+1}}{r-g_L}$
$D_{n+1}=D_0(1+g_S)^n(1+g_L)$

<h4>MULTIPLER MODELS AND RELATIONSHIP AMONG PRICE MULTIPLES, PRESENT VALUE MODELS, AND FUNDAMENTALS</h4>
<!--  -->
justified value of a multiple: the value justified by (based on) fundamentals or a set of cash flow predictions
justified P/E ratio (called related to fundamentals): $P_0=\frac{D_1}{r-g}$, $\frac{P_0}{E_1}=\frac{D_1/E_1}{r-g}=\frac{p}{r-g}$, where $p$ is payout ratio

<h4>METHOD OF COMPARABLES AND VALUATION BASED ON PRICE MULTIPLES</h4>
<h4>ENTERPRISE VALUE</h4>
<!--  -->
Enterprise value: market capitalization + market value of preferred stock + market value of debt - cash and investments (cash equivalents and short-term investments)
EV/EBITDA or EV/operating income

<h4>ASSET-BASED VALUATION</h4>
<!--  -->
The asset-based valuation approach is most applicable when: the market value is readily determinable and the intangible assets are of a small proportion
