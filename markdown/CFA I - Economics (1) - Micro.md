<h3>Demand analysis</h3>
<!--  -->
law of demand: price increases, buyers buy less; because of substitution effect and income effect (real income increases) 
defmand function: $Q_x^d=f(P_x,I,P_y)$
inverse demand function: $P_x=8.92-0.156Q_x^d$
demand curve: graph of inverse demand function
own-price elasticity of demand: $E_{P_x}^d=\frac{\%\Delta Q_x^d}{\%\Delta P_x}=\frac{\Delta Q_x^d}{\Delta P_x}\frac{P_x}{Q_x^d}$
elastic: $|E_{P_x}^d|>1$; inelastic: $|E_{P_x}|^d< 1$; unitary elastic: $|E_{P_x}^d|=1$
perfectly elastic: individual seller under perfectly competitive market
predictive of elasticity of demand: substitutability, portion of the budget spent on the good, the amount of time to respond to the price change, whether the good is necessary or optional
for seller: increase price under inelasiticity could decrease demand and save total production cost
income elasticity of demand: $E_{I}^d=\frac{\%\Delta Q_x^d}{\%\Delta I}$
normal good: $E_{I}^d>0$; inferior food: $E_{I}^d< 0$
cross-price elasticity of demand: $E_{y}^d=\frac{\%\Delta Q_x^d}{\%\Delta P_y}$
substitutes: $E_{y}^d>0$; complements: $E_{y}^d< 0$
substitute effect is true for both normal and inferior good
Giffen good (inferior good and income effect overwhelms substitute effect): prices increases and demand increases; Veblen good (not inferior good): e.g. luxury good
an method to decompose income effect and substitute effect: Consumer can pay an amount of money to have the privilege to buy good at a lower price, we adjust this privilege price until the consumer is indifferent (same level of utility), and see whether the good demand is increased
<h3>Supply analysis</h3>
<!--  -->
law of diminishing marginal returns (marginal product decreases with additional input units)
$TC=wL+rK$, $L$ and $K$ are laboring and capital hours (firm seen as renting machines, because of the opportunity cost)
cost function: $C=f(Q)$, production cost for given amount of output
total product, average product, marginal product
economic profit = total revenue (TR) - economic costs
accounting profit = total revenue (TR) - accounting cost
marginal cost consists of short-run marginal cost (SMC) and long-run marginal cost (LMC), $SMC =\frac{w}{MP_L}$
average (on units of output) variable cost (AVC) = $\frac{w}{AP_L}$
total cost (TC) = total fixed cost (TFC) + total variable cost (TVC)
quasi-fixed cost (fixed inside of some range), part of TFC
<!--  -->
A firm is said to break even if its TR is equal to its TC.
Economic costs are the sum of total accounting costs and implicit opportunity costs.
A firm whose revenue is equal to its economic costs is covering the opportunity cost of all of its factors of production, including capital. Economists would say that such a firm is earning normal profit, but not positive economic profit. It is earning a rate of return on capital just equal to the rate of return that an investor could expect to earn in an equivalently risky alternative investment (opportunity cost).
In the long run, the best a firm can do is to break even because of other entrants.

In the example of TC, opportunity of the asset is reflected in the MVC (return of asset) and TC (could have sold the machine)?
<!--  -->
LRAC curve is an envelope curve of SATC curve:
<p class="wrapper" style="text-align:center;">
<img src="images/CFA I/CFA I-Economics-supply analysis-lrac.png" width="600px" max-width="100%" align="center"></p>
The minimum point on the LRAC curve is referred to as the minimum efficient scale. The minimum efficient scale is the optimal firm size under perfect competition over the long run.


<h3>Market structures analysis</h3>
<!--  -->
perfect competition, monopolistic competition (cola, cosmetics), oligopoly, and monopoly
five factors determine market structure:
* The number and relative size of firms supplying the product;
* The degree of product differentiation;
* The power of the seller over pricing decisions;
* The relative strength of the barriers to market entry and exit;
* The degree of non-price competition.

$ε_P = –\frac{\%\Delta Q_x^d}{\%\Delta P_x}$
Consumer surplus is defined as the difference between the value that a consumer places on the units purchased and the amount of money that was required to pay for them. Demand curve can therefore be considered a marginal value curve
<h4>Oligopoly</h4>
<!--  -->
There are three basic pricing strategies: pricing interdependence (price war), the Cournot assumption, and the Nash equilibrium
pricing interdependence: DD is the demand curve when all participants make the same move, dd is the demand curve when only one participant make that move, which explains the price stability, but not the initial price:

In long run, market share is temporary.
<h4>Cournot</h4>
In the Cournot assumption, each firm determines its profit-maximizing production level by assuming that the other firms’ output will not change
<h4>Nash equilibrium</h4>
<!-- -->
formal price collusion is called cartel, 6 factors:
* The number and size distribution of sellers
* The similarity of the products
* Cost structure
* Order size and frequency
* The strength and severity of retaliation
* The degree of external competition
<h4>Stackelberg model</h4>
the leader firm chooses its output first and then the follower firm chooses after observing the leader’s output


<h3>Monopoly</h3>
<!--  -->
factors: patent/copyright, control over critical resources, government-controlled authorization (because of the significant entry cost), brand loyalty and Network effects (result from synergies related to increasing market penetration)
*besides quantity and price, monopolist can also adjust the quality
<h3>Price discrimination</h3>
<!--  -->
first degree: perfect
second degree: quantity-based
third degree: customer-based
<h3>Identification of market structure</h3>
<!--  -->
econometric: regression
concentration ratio
Herfindahl–Hirschman index (HHI): square of the market share
