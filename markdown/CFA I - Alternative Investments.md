<h4>Investment methods</h4>
<!--  -->
fund investing, co-investing (gaining experience) and direct investing
co-investing may spell adverse selection bias: fund manager may make less attractive investment opportunities available to the co-investor while allocating its own capital to more appealing deals

<h4>Investment and compensation structures</h4>
<!--  -->
general partner is fund manager, limited partner is investor 
limited partnership agreement + side letters
management fee based on AUM (hedge fund) or committed capital (private equity)
committed capital: LP's promised fund
performance fee is earned after hurdle rate, hard hurdle rate is used if performance fee calculated based on return rate excess of hurdle rate
catch-up clause: split hurdle rate as soft hurdle rate
high-water mark: to avoid paying twice for the same performance
clawback provision: for losses
waterfall is distribution method: deal-by-deal (American) and whole-of-the fund (European)

<h4>Hedge funds</h4>
<!--  -->
extended holding periods (known as lockup periods) and subsequent notice periods before  redemption
FOF charge additional management fee

* mezzanine debt: subordinated to senior debt, prior to equity
* venture debt: start-up and early stage
* distressed debt: turnaround investors, hoping company and debt increases value
* collateralized loan obligations (CLN): various kinds of loan together, an ABS; CDO could include any kind of debt, like RMBS
* unittranche debt: blend of various debt, a single rate

risk:
infrastructure debt < senior real estate debt < senior direct lending < unitranche debt < debt mezzanine < private equity


<h4>Natural resources</h4>
<!--  -->

Futures price ≈ Spot price(1 + r) + Storage costs − Convenience yield
contango: futures price > spot price; backwardation: futures price < spot price
Timberland return: biological return, price change of product, price change of land
