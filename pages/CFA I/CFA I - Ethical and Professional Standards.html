<h3 id="nav1">Ethics and trust in the investment profession</h3>
<h4 id="nav1.1">Ethics</h4>
<p>ethics is a set of shared belief about what is good or acceptable and what is bad or unacceptable behavior</p>
<ul>
<li>conduct that improve outcomes for stakeholders</li>
<li>balance your self-interest with the impact on others</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="nav1.2">Ethics and professionalism</h4>
<h5>Code</h5>
<p>code is a set of moral principles that guides by describing what is acceptable behavior</p>
<ul>
<li>minimum level of ethical behavior</li>
</ul>
<h5>Profession</h5>
<p>profession is an occupational community that has specific education, expert knowledge and a framework of practice and behavior</p>
<ul>
<li>professional code of ethics is a way for profession to communicate to the public</li>
<li>does not ensure all member follow</li>
<li>uphold high ethical standard is a difference between professions and craft guilds</li>
</ul>
<p>for profession, a primary goal is to establish trust among clients and among society in general<br/>
fiduciary duty (受托责任) is the obligation to deliver a high standard of care when acting the benefit of another party<br/>
professions are evolving</p>
<h5>Professionalism in investment management</h5>
<p>the code for investment is still developing<br/>
trust in investment management:</p>
<ul>
<li>investment management professionals are trusted to draw on a body of formal knowledge and apply that knowledge with care and judgement</li>
<li>investment management profession and investment firms must be interdependent</li>
</ul>
<p>CFA Institute as an investment management professional body:</p>
<ul>
<li>mission is "to lead the investment profession globally, by promoting the highest standards of  ethics, education and professional excellence for the ultimate benefit of society"</li>
</ul>
<h5>Challenges to ethical conduct</h5>
<p>individuals tend to overrate the ethical quality of their behavior<br/>
decision makers fail to recognize or underestimate the effect of situational influence (external influence more important than personal trait):</p>
<ul>
<li>social pressure from others, violate when they place more importance on self-interest and short-term results than long-term results and ethical quality</li>
<li>overstrict rule run the risk of so focused on adhering to compliance rules</li>
</ul>
<h5>Ethical vs. legal standards</h5>
<p>illegal but ethical: whistleblowing<br/>
legal but unethical: recommending investment in relative firms<br/>
ethical principle often sets a higher standard of behavior than laws and regulations：</p>
<ul>
<li>new law and regulations often result from recent instances of what is perceived as unethical</li>
</ul>
<p>ethical decisions require more judgement and consideration of the impact on stakeholders compared to legal decisions</p>
<h5>Ethical decision-making frameworks</h5>
<p>integrated into a firm decision process<br/>
framework: identify, consider, act and reflect</p>
<h3 id="nav2">Code of ethics</h3>
<h4 id="nav2.1">Proceedings (诉讼)</h4>
<p>primary principles: fairness and confidentialailty<br/>
Disciplinary Review Committee (DRC) of the Board has responsibiliy for the Professional Conduct Program (PCP) and enforcement of the Code and Standards<br/>
the hearing panel when rejecting disciplinary sanction consists of DRC and CFA Institute member volunteer</p>
<h5>Asset management code of professional conduct</h5>
AMC was constructed for asset management firm and asset manager
<h5>Code</h5>
<ul>
<li>Act with integrity, competence, diligence, respect, and in an ethical manner with the public, clients, prospective clients, employers, employees, colleagues in the investment profession, and other participants in the global capital market</li>
<li>Place the integrity of the investment profession and the interests of clients above their own personal interests</li>
<li>Use reasonable care and exercise independent professional judgement when conducting investment analysis, making investment recommendations, taking investment actions, and engaging in other professional activities</li>
<li>Practice and encourage others to practice in a professional and ethical manner that will reflect credit on themselves and the profession.</li>
<li>Promote the integrity and viability of the global capital markets for the ultimate benefit of society</li>
<li>Maintain and improve their professional competence and strive to maintain and improve the competence of other investment professionals</li>
